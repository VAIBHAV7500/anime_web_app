His powers were sealed at birth into the demon-slaying blade Kurikara, or Koumaken, by Mephisto Pheles, allowing him to live a normal human life for about 15 years. Rin became aware of his true identity after Kurikara could no longer seal the blue flames he inherited from Satan, setting a chain of events that led to the death of his guardian, Father and Exorcist Fujimoto Shiro, at the hands of Satan who attempted to drag Rin back to the demon realm. Exorcist Mephisto Pheles confronted Rin after Shiro\'s funeral with several exorcists, giving Rin the option to kill them all or die. Rin instead demanded to become an exorcist, an idea that amused Mephisto. Rin was then enrolled personally by Mephisto into the True Cross Academy Exorcist School, and since been pursuing his goal to become a Paladin and to defeat Satan. He is currently an Exwire and attempting to gain the title of Meister as a \"Knight\". Rin can tap into the power he has inherited from Satan through the use of a demon-slaying katana, called Kurikara or Koumaken. The sheath acts as a portal to Gehenna (the demon world) which when drawn returns Rin to his demon form. While in his human form, Rin exhibits a number of physical traits that are signs of his demonic nature, such as sharper-looking teeth, slightly pointed ears, and a black, fur tufted tail (which he keeps hidden in his shirt). As a demon, Rin gains two blue flames that float above his head, long, elf-like ears, and his eyes turn bright blue. In both forms Rin can almost control his destructive bright blue flames, the trademark sign of Satan. However, when he draws Kurikara, the magnitude of the flames dramatically increase and often leads to Rin being \"consumed\" by his own flames and losing his mind. Rin also has a demon Familiar Cat Sith, Kuro, who was initially Father Fujimoto\'s.  \n(Sources: Viz, Blue Exorcist volume one manga extras)','2020-10-19 11:23:47','2020-10-19 11:23:47','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n24482-lvOeN02vmDQI.jpg','MC'),(96,'Satan','Satan is the king of Gehenna.

But due to her youth, she tends to exhibit dangerous overzealousness. Her ability to sense \"Od\" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts.

Isshin also seems to enjoy making fun of Ichigo and has a tendency to talk to the large memorial poster of his late wife Masaki, which he has pinned up in their kitchen, whenever he feels particularly emotional. Isshin is a big fan of Don Kanonji&#039;s TV show.    Despite his outrageous guise, however, Isshin can be serious and grim at times. On the date of Masaki&#039;s death, Isshin smokes a single cigarette in front of her grave, since she thought it made him look cool (she said it when they were dating). He reflects that it was the first and last time she ever complimented his appearance. He also told Ichigo that he shouldn&#039;t blame himself for his mother&#039;s death because she gave her life to protect him. In addition, during his confrontation with the arrancar Grand Fisher and the subsequent chat with Kisuke Urahara, he remains completely serious (aside from a short argument between him and Kon about his parenting, and another, albeit short, between him and Urahara after the latter likens him to his son).    Isshin appears to be an associate of Kisuke Urahara and possesses knowledge of Sōsuke Aizen&#039;s alliance with the Menos. He mentions in his conversation with Urahara that he encountered arrancar about ten years before the main storyline, though they were nowhere near as complete as Fisher. He also reveals to Kon that he has been aware of Ichigo&#039;s shinigami activities and Kon&#039;s substitutions since Grand Fisher&#039;s first attack. He also notes that he has never called Kon &quot;Ichigo&quot; while Kon is in Ichigo&#039;s body and that the traveling charm he gave Ichigo before he went to rescue Rukia was actually for Kon (it&#039;s a protection talisman). This shows the sensitivity and propriety that he possesses of his role as Ichigo&#039;s father, which is rarely portrayed in the series.    Isshin also shares a relationship with Ryūken Ishida not unlike that of their sons. When Ryūken discovers his son is missing, Isshin pays him a visit and the two chat about their respective styles of parenting. It is then revealed that Ryūken was aware of Isshin&#039;s status, and he comments on Isshin&#039;s powers. The Bleach Official Animation Book VIBEs states that the two have some prior history together, and that they have been acquaintances for quite some time. It can also be noted they both are doctors, Isshin runs a clinic while Ryūken runs a hospital. There have been hints that the two cooperate on a professional level, with Isshin handling minor cases, and occasionally requesting aid from Ryūken.     __Theme Song:__ &quot;Don&#039;t Drag Me Down&quot; by Social Distortion','2020-10-19 11:24:16','2020-10-19 11:24:16','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/2553.jpg','MC'),(214,'Kaname Tousen','Birthday: November 13  Height: 176 cm (5&#039;9&quot;)  Weight: 61 kg (134 lbs)    Kaname Tousen was formerly the Captain of the 9th Division of the Gotei 13. He was revealed as a co-conspirator working for Sousuke Aizen and left Soul Society along with him and Gin Ichimaru. He then became a Commander in Aizen&#039;s Army of Arrancar. The Soul Society ordeal put him at odds with his formerly closest friend Sajin Komamura, as well as his former Lieutenant in the 9th Division, Shuuhei Hisagi.    Tousen&#039;s creed in life is to &quot;take the path with the least bloodshed&quot;; it was for this reason that he felt it necessary to follow Sousuke Aizen. Despite this, he knows of Aizen&#039;s plan to create the King&#039;s Key, which will require the deaths of thousands of innocent people. He was also willing to attack and kill members of his own division while acting as the 5th seat, including Hollowfying his own captain. Tousen, along with Gin Ichimaru was identified by Kenpachi Zaraki as being afraid of death, this is later confirmed with him saying he only feared being assimilated into the Shinigami culture and dying a pointless death. His own description of himself as a &quot;pure being&quot; when explaining why Wonderweiss Margela likes him shows degrees of pride and arrogance as well. Also, despite stating many times how much his friend loved the world, he himself never said so, and in fact hated the world that took away his friend.    As Captain of the 9th Division, which is charged with the editing of Seireitei Communication, Tousen was the chief editor of the journal. He himself wrote a serialization titled &quot;The Path of Justice&quot;, which was not very popular, until he began to publish cooking recipes in his articles, which made them more popular among female Shinigami. This also indicates that his speciality is indeed cooking, his favorite dishes being chicken stewed with carrots and other sophisticated ones. He does not like pickled food.    Tousen also has several unique relationships with the Arrancars. Tousen thinks of Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez in the same manner as Kenpachi Zaraki; a killing machine that will cause only more bloodshed in the world. Wonderweiss Margera seems to have a great affection towards him. Tousen explains that this is because they are both pure spirits, and that pure spirits tend to attract and follow each other.

He has also acquired a series of golden peircings in his time as a vizard, one in his eyebrow and three on his left ear. He bears a small resemblance to Jin Kariya of the Bounts. \n\n__Personality: __ Unlike some of the other Vizard, Kensei is portrayed as a much more serious character, often angry at the others for their immaturity. A skilled and respected battlefield commander, he has a rather brutal fighting style quite often blasting his opponents apart. When outside of battle he has a blunt and slightly aggressive attitude, trying to cheer up a tearful Hisagi in a manner reminiscent of an army drill sergeant, though he seems more passive as a Vizard. He is most frequently irritated by his former lieutenant Mashiro Kuna due to her childish airheaded manner, he once noted she had the uncanny ability to aggravate him even when asleep.   _ __History: __ _  Approximately 100 years ago, Kensei was the captain of the 9th division with Kuna Mashiro serving as his lieutenant, though she easily annoyed him due her childish behavior. During an investigation of mysterious disappearances in Rukongai he fought off a giant Hollow, and saved Shūhei Hisagi in the process, who would eventually become Lieutenant of the 9th division. During the night his entire group was attacked and he was stabbed from behind by Kaname Tōsen. Following this he appeared as a half Hollow and attacked Hiyori Sarugaki and then Shinji Hirako. He was then restrained by Hachi\'s Kido binding spell. He and the others were eventually saved from turning into Hollows and death by Soul Society, by Kisuke Urahara. They then escaped to earth. \n\n__Powers: __ Tachikaze (断地風, lit. Earth-Severing Wind): When sealed, it is shown as a short katana with a rectangular guard in an \'H\' shape and white hilt weaving.   \n\n__Shikai:__ Kensei\'s Shikai is triggered by the command Blow it away (吹っ飛ばせ, futtobase) in which it shrinks down to the size of a survival/combat knife with a small ring on the hilts blunt edge.    \n__Shikai Special Ability:__ While in this form, Kensei demonstrates the ability to charge and fire spiritual energy from the blade as well as creating a transparent air blade to cut enemies from a distance. He appears to be quite powerful, easily destroying a giant hollow with one blast and blowing off the arm of Ichigo\'s hollow form. In the video games, his fighting style resembles that of Western Boxing combined with Tachikaze. \n\n__Hollowfication:__ Kensei is unique among the Vizard so far in that he seems to prefer his Shinigami abilities over his Hollow powers. His hollow self is a large bulky humanoid with armored hands and feet and with a number of thick cylindrical protrusions on its back and forearms.   \n\n__Vizard__ Hollow Mask: His hollow mask resembles a flat hockey face guard with six slitted eye holes in two columns and extensions which frame his head.

He usually takes responsibility, and tends to avoid violence when possible. He seems to be virtuous, much like his Captain\'s image; until later, when it was revealed his Captain was a traitor. He is often seen in the company of Renji and Kira. Along with Hinamori, Renji and Kira followed Shūhei as their senpai during their academy days. Omake chapters also show that he is quite perverted.  \n\nShuuhei has several tattoos: the number 69 on his face, a line across his face and has three lines running vertically down the right side of his face, scars that resulted from an injury in the past when several huge hollows attacked a group of students he was leading into the living world for a lesson in fighting dummy hollows. Very little is known about Shuuhei\'s abilities, though it\'s known that even during his days in the academy he was quite skilled, commonly leading other shinigami trainees on mock missions. However, Izuru Kira mentions that Shuuhei failed the entrance exam for the academy twice. His talent allowed him to become a seated officer in the Gotei 13 without having to pass additional tests. \n\nHe has never released his Zanpakuto until his battle with Findor Carias, one of Barragan\'s Fraccion. When the Arrancar released his Resureccion, Pinsa Guda, Shuuhei released his Zanpakuto. Its name is Kazeshini with the release command \"Reap.\" Its sealed form is a katana with an octangular tsuba.  He\'s also shown as a child in the Pendulum Arc. This is when he first met Mugurama Kensei who saved him from a Hollow. Shuuhei was then inspired by Kensei, thus adding the 69 tattoo to his face to match the one on Kensei\'s stomach.  Apart from being the vice captain of the 9th division, he has to run the Soul Society\'s newspaper/magazine \"Seireitei Communication\" as he takes over the chief editor position after his Captain, Tosen, betrayed the Soul Society.  Shuuhei was taught by Tosen to fear his power, so he doesn\'t rely much on his Zanpakuto\'s power. \n\nHe is a very skilled swordsman, and is also talented at Kido. One of the spells he is always seen to be using is Binding Spell #62 Hyapporankan (百歩欄干, Hundred Steps Fence). He was first seen using this in the second Bleach movie, The Diamond Dust Rebellion, to try to capture Hitsugaya.

This past has driven her to become rather introverted and melancholic, preferring to stay silent in her captain&#039;s presence. Their relationship is far from the average father-daughter one, as Mayuri doesn&#039;t seem to care much for Nemu&#039;s well-being (using her as bait in combat). The most that can be said in his favor is that he has occasionally implied concern over her life as a point of personal pride in his own skill as her creator. Despite being abused and mistreated in every possible way by her captain and father, Nemu still shows great loyalty to him, and has openly expressed worry at the prospect of his death, likely due to her implied gratitude that Kurotsuchi brought her into the world. Unlike her father, however, she seems to have compassion for others, saving Uryū Ishida&#039;s life as a thank you for not killing Mayuri. Based on the 13 squad episode endings and the Bount arc, Nemu&#039;s fighting style seems to be a combination of capoeira-like martial arts, and kidō attacks.    Nemu&#039;s body was designed to withstand fatal injury, though still suffers the pain brought on by her injuries. This extends to being able to survive impregnation by Szayel Aporro Granz, a process meant to bring him back to life while leaving his host as an empty husk. Mayuri can repair Nemu very quickly in these situations, allowing her to continue doing her father&#039;s bidding. Nemu is also immune to Mayuri&#039;s many poisons.

She also holds various poisons and potions derived from Mayuri&#039;s research in her own body, making her highly dangerous to those that attack her internally.

He is extremely tall and appears to be much older than he actually is. Chad has a tattoo on his left shoulder which reads Amore e Morte (\"love and death\" in Italian) and consists of a heart, a snake and angel wings around the heart. In the series, he is usually seen wearing either his school uniform or a t-shirt. At one point in the series, he is seen wearing a dark, long-sleeved shirt with a rose emblazoned on the left sleeve. The rose may be in honor of his grandfather seeing as how his grandfather\'s name was Oscar Joaquín de la Rosa, de la Rosa being Spanish for \"of the Rose.\"  Chad is a quiet person and is sometimes the subject of jokes or bullies because he never fights back, against ordinary humans, or often hollows and Soul Reapers until necessary. Nonetheless, he is treated equally within his group of friends in Karakura (Ichigo, Keigo and Mizuiro). Chad also has a weakness for cute things, like small animals and Kon, and is one of the few characters that actually treats Kon with any dignity but for the most part ignores him. To match his extraordinary size, Chad possesses extraordinary superhuman durability, even before activating his spiritual powers, being able to survive the impact of a falling steel girder on his back and a head-on motorcycle collision, and is strong enough to break telephone poles and wield them as giant clubs, even when already injured. Besides his physical strength, Chad has also shown to be very intelligent; he ranked 10th out of 322 in school, while Ichigo ranked 23rd.  Chad likes music, but rarely watches TV. The only programs he likes are Carnivore Kingdom, which starts at 8 a.m. on Sundays. He likes it so much that he bought the DVDs for it. Not surprisingly, since Kon is a cheap knock-off plushie of the main character of Carnivore Kingdom, Chad finds Kon especially cute. The other show is Don Kan\'onji\'s Ghost Bust. Chad also has a bass guitar, but has never been shown playing it. It has been shown in Chad\'s room in episode 69 and in the 8th anime ending sequence.

Karin is a sensible person and will not hesitate to kick her father in the head when she thinks he\'s acting unreasonable. She initially claims that she believes spirits do not exist, yet can see them just as well as Ichigo can. She can also sense them from great distances, which usually manifests as a headache.

He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.  When he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.  As a teenager, Ichigo\'s personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he\'s unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.  When Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakutō is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo\'s spiritual power, which he didn\'t know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakutō in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia\'s deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power.   ~!Ichigo is an extremely rare case. Despite being a Shinigami, he is still a living Human being and resides in the Human World, rather than in Soul Society. Uniquely, he gained his own powers through Urahara\'s training/forced encroachment, which simultaneously gave him Hollow powers. Due to his Hollow powers, Ichigo is technically classified as a Visored, but he still thinks and refers to himself as a Shinigami. For all purposes, Ichigo is a Human in physical body and Visored in spiritual body, thus making his situation even rarer. After losing his Shinigami powers Ichigo returns to being a human, this time with no spiritual power or spiritual awareness at all. His enormous spiritual power capacity was being Kurosaki Isshin\'s Offspring, letting him see ghosts and hollows from a very young age. It was revealed that he has access to Quincy powers, due to his mother.!~','2020-10-19 11:24:18','2020-10-19 11:24:18','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b5-RxGEMJZLW4cy.png','MC'),(226,'Charlotte Chuhlhourne','Charlotte Chuhlhourne is a large, bulky and muscular Arrancar that dresses very feminine.

An alternate romanization of his name is Findore Klarius  He appears to be the most composed member of Barragan\'s fraccion. He is rather arrogant and confident in his abilities, as shown when he encounters Shūhei Hisagi and states that he will fight at exactly the same power level as a Lieutenant. He is also said to be very chatty and is called a \"chatterbox\" by Hisagi. Findor seems to be quite intelligent and calculating, being able to guess the average power levels of seated Shinigami officers and even replicate them while fighting. His analytical demeanor is also demonstrated by his habit of saying \"exacta\" (correct) very often. This stems from his belief that life is nothing but a sequence of difficult problems, and ones ability to make correct choices decides his fate.   The remains of his hollow mask consist of a smooth helmet covering the upper half of his face, with eye holes, and a row of teeth sown across his chin like a strap. His hollow hole is not visible. Findor\'s arrancar outfit vaguely resembles a Spanish soldier and he has customized it with shoulder pads, knee-high boots, and a knife like protrusion on both his sleeves that extend along the top of his hands  Synopsis  He first appears along with Barragan and the rest of his Fracción in the fake Karakura Town to do battle with the Gotei 13. Once Aizen, Ichimaru, and Tōsen are blocked off by Yamamoto\'s shikai, Barragan himself decides to give all orders. Findor is then ordered to summon four gigantic hollows to destroy the four pillars that keep the real Karakura Town in Soul Society.[2] The hollows are killed however by Shūhei Hisagi, Izuru Kira, Yumichika Ayasegawa and Ikkaku Madarame, who are protecting the pillars.   In response, Barragan sends each member of his Fracción to a different pillar stating that if they are going to guard them using ants he\'ll just have to send dragons to crush them. Findor is sent to do battle with Shūhei Hisagi.[3] The two duel for a while before Hisagi comments that his power appears only at that of a fifth seat. Findor replies that he has passed this test and he will now fight at a lieutenant\'s level. Using the knife attached to his wrist he begins breaking off fragments of his mask increasing his power each time, finally breaking off half saying he is at lieutenant level.  After fighting for some time Findor finds that Shūhei isn\'t fighting at the level he believes to be lieutenant as Shūhei is the only one that is tired. Wanting to finish the battle, Findor releases his zanpakutō. After fighting for a while longer he forces Shūhei to release his own zanpakutō much to Findor\'s own surprise. He later removes 90% of his mask and told Shūhei that he\'s power is now Captain-level, but he was defeated by Shūhei instead. His current fate is unknown, but he\'s believed to be dead.   Powers and Abilities  Findor appears to be able to summon hollows by whistling as shown when he was ordered to destroy the four pillars that keep the real Karakura Town in Soul Society, though this is, most possibly, an ability shared, but not demonstrated by other high-ranking, Arrancar or even non-arrancar MenosAdjuchas.     Curiously, his hollow mask appears to act as some kind of inhibitor on his powers (similar to Kenpachi\'s eye-patch), and by breaking fragments of it off with the knife on his wrist, it can increase his power exponentially. When whole, his power level is equal to that of a fifth seat Shinigami, and when half of his mask he is broken he is as strong as a Lieutenant  Zanpakutō  Findor\'s zanpakutō is named Pinza Aguda (蟄刀流断 (ピンサグーダ, Pinsagūda; Spanish for \"sharp pincer,\" Japanese for \"crab sword cutting current\") and its release command is \"Engrave in the water surface\" (水面に刻め, minamo ni kizame). Its sealed form resembles a Spanish épée or rapier. When released, it wraps around his right arm to form a giant crustacean claw. In this form, Findor can fire high-pressure streams of water from his claw that are powerful enough to easily cut through buildings.   _Source: Bleach official character book III_','2020-10-19 11:24:18','2020-10-19 11:24:18','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/15795.jpg','MC'),(228,'Uryuu Ishida',' __Date of Birth:__ November 6 (Scorpio)  \n__Age:__ 15(formerly)-17  \n__Species:__ Human (Quincy)  \n__Height:__ 171(formerly)-177 cm  \n__Weight:__ 55 kg (formerly)-57 kg   \n__Blood Type:__ AB  \n__Hair Color:__ Black  \n__Eye Color:__ Blue  \n__Occupation:__ High School Student, Quincy  \n__Theme Song:__ \"Idioteque\" by Radiohead  \n__Artifacts &amp; Weapons:__  Quincy Bow &amp; Spirit Arrows Sanrei Glove Quincy Bangle Seele Schneider Silver Tubes  \n__Known relatives__ Ryuuken Ishida (father)  Souken Ishida (grandfather, deceased)   \n\nUryuu is a friend of Ichigo\'s and one of the last surviving Quincy. Uryuu Ishida is a dark blue-haired, bespectacled teenager of average height. At school, Uryuu wears the school uniform along with a tie, while outside he dons white Quincy clothes with blue stripes representing the Quincy cross, and a mantle.  Uryuu is generally shy and quiet, but tries harder to act cool when other people are around. For example, during the Soul Society arc he wears a mantle that serves no purpose other than to make him look cooler, despite the fact that it hinders his movement. He even keeps a spare to that effect. In addition, he also has a tendency to say things with characteristic drama. Uryuu operates on a moral ethic known as the \"Pride of the Quincy\" and has a strong sense of justice. He has also shown to be very chivalrous, stating that he enacts justice on men who abuse or treat women badly. He demonstrates this at multiple points throughout the series, such as when he tried to defend Rukia Kuchiki from Renji Abarai when he and Byakuya Kuchiki came to the real world to take her, or when he defends Orihime Inoue at multiple points throughout the Soul Society arc. Uryuu also has a tendency to not use lethal force in battle, especially if he can win without doing so. Instead, he will simply incapacitate his opponent.  Uryuu does not hold his father, Ryuuken Ishida, in high respect; he calls his father by his given name which is considered very rude in Japanese society. Despite this, in the anime Uryuu seems mildly offended when Rukia commented that the Ishida\'s hospital (his father being the present director) is falling apart and Renji replies tactlessly that the hospital is only for show.  Uryuu has low blood pressure and hates procrastination. The other things he hates are quite odd: buttons (despite being an expert in sewing) and the word \"haphazard.\" His favorite food is homemade mackerel miso stew. The television program he likes is Don Kanonji\'s \"Bura-Rei.\" The shadow that jumped out of the crowd at Kanonji\'s first appearance was in fact Uryuu.

The Asano family consists of Keigo\'s mother, father, his sister Mizuho, and Keigo himself. Like Tatsuki Arisawa, he is unusual in that he lives with both of his parents, unlike many other recurring characters in the series.  A good-natured teenager, Keigo is used mainly for comical effect, usually in situations involving failed attempts to woo girls and interacting with Ichigo. He is good friends with fellow student Mizuiro Kōjima, whose calm, innocent demeanor, and success with women acts as a foil to Keigo\'s impulsive, wannabe personality.  Keigo appears to be a shallow character at first glance, with a passion for slacking off. Indeed, he takes great pride in not making it to the honors roster (higher than the 50th ranking) and labels those who do so \"traitors\" (including Ichigo and Chad, who made the 23rd and 11th ranks respectively). However, Mizuiro states that Keigo is much smarter than his bad grades show.  Later, it is revealed that Keigo can see ghosts and even soul reapers, in the Hueco Mundo/Arrancar arc.

He is generally a laid-back, jovial fellow, although he can be dead serious when the situation warrants it. Despite his carefree attitude, his speech is always polite, though it is sometimes sarcastic. Yoruichi Shihouin notes that he tends to go over the top with whatever he becomes passionate about. He once described himself as a \"mere honest, handsome, perverted businessman.\" During the Bount arc of the anime, when Ganju Shiba calls Urahara an \"old man,\" Urahara replies that he is the same age as Ganju\'s sister, Kūkaku Shiba.   Urahara can usually be found near the scene of an important event, but will rarely step in to intervene, preferring to be in control from outside. After the event is over (i.e. the battle between Ichigo Kurosaki and Renji Abarai), he kindly pops up and helps the side he deems fit. Thus far, it has tended to be the side of the protagonists. He often tends to know more than he reveals and tends to have some form of relationship with most of the story\'s characters.

He serves as the primary antagonist of the Shie Hassaikai Arc.\n\nOverhaul is a mysophobic, antisocial sociopath obsessed with returning the world to the way it was before the Quirk phenomenon. Due to a combination of an old theory claiming Quirks derived from rats and his own mysophobia, Overhaul believes that Quirks are actually a plague on humanity, having infected people with \"syndromes\" of heroism and villainy. He looks down upon those that use their abilities for either purpose, referring to acts of heroic sacrifice or petty crime as \"sicknesses\". Overhaul is extremely determined to his ambition of eradicating Quirks, not only due to his own personal phobias, but also because such a thing would allow the yakuza to reclaim the power they once held over society. Overhaul has no moral compass and an enormous ego, viewing himself as the only person in the world that\'s enlightened to the \"true nature\" of Quirks and deserving of the spot as ruler of the underworld after the fall of All For One.\n\nOverall Abilities: Overhaul is an incredibly powerful villain that garnered the attention of All For One, the most powerful villain in Japan. He is a very dangerous individual due to his Quirk, Overhaul, the handling he has on it, and his own lack of remorse. In the past, when he recruited Kendo Rappa into the Shie Hassaikai, Kendo proposed that, in order to gain his servitude, Overhaul has to defeat him in battle. But just as Kendo prepared an attack, the Yakuza leader effortlessly disassembled, then reassembled Kendo. Even after Kendo become a member of the Eight Bullets, Overhaul was challenged by him 5 times, subsequently overhauling and defeating the brawler with each attempt. When he first encountered the League of Villains, Overhaul was able to instantly destroy Magne, as well as the left arm of Mr. Compress, both of which had the mettle to attack the Yakuza leader.\n~!This allowed him to overpower Sir Nighteye, All Might\'s former sidekick; and Izuku, an inheritor of One For All.

Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki (紅月ナオト Kōzuki Naoto?), with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.  Both Kallen\'s stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they\'re reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.  Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen\'s character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.  Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.  As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would\'ve gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).  In an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads. Certain aspects of Kallen\'s character such as her girlish naivete and competitiveness made it easy for the voice actress to relate, even to the point of admitting that in some ways they act very much the same.','2020-10-19 11:24:53','2020-10-19 11:24:53','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b558-8tSMZ4a0LWrn.jpg','SC'),(392,'Suzaku Kururugi','__Age:__ 17 (first season), 18 (second season)         \n__Date of Birth:__ July 10, 2000 a.t.b.         \n__Zodiac Sign:__ Cancer         \n__Blood Type:__ O         \n__Height:__ 176cm (5\'9\")         \n__Nationality:__ Japanese         \n__Known Relatives:__ Genbu Kururugi (father, deceased), Kaguya Sumeragi (cousin)\n__Knightmare Frame:__ Lancelot and Lancelot Albion\n\nLelouch\'s childhood friend and son of Japan\'s last prime minister.

A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.  Lelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the King\", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.   With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.   ~!Lelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother\'s assassination and his sister\'s crippling in the same incident. A ten year old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict.  It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch\'s use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister\'s safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother\'s allies.  His mother\'s death and his father\'s apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother\'s death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.  Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen Kōzuki\'s resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.  Lelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about.  Originally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother\'s death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally\'s death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him.  The turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights\' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces.  Lelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.!~  Season Two:  ~!One year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch\'s memories and suppress his power.  Lelouch\'s memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation\'s consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally\'s new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer.  The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.\'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely.  After Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world\'s lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased.  Lelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally\'s safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch\'s various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel\'s troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship.  In the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku\'s imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him.  With his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.!~  Geass:  Lelouch\'s Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \"the power of absolute obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person\'s mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.   ~!In the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.!~  Of all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch\'s has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.      * Commands must be issued verbally.     * The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.     * Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah\'s Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.     * The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don\'t know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.     * An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.     * The victim\'s memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.     * A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.  So long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.  Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkirō requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.  Lelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.\'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao\'s identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot\'s actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku\'s reflexes saved his life).  Lelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan\'s population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch\'s persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is \"a lot like his father.\"  Physically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch\'s traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.  Lelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).  Lelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero.    ~!After stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkirō, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare.!~   ~!At the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people\'s hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness. After Lelouch died, Nunnally realized that without her brother she cannot live even though she was away from him for a very long time.!~','2020-10-19 11:24:53','2020-10-19 11:24:53','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b417-g3V3tevxfgsN.jpg','SC'),(394,'Milly Ashford','__Age:__ 18  \n__Birthday:__ July 24th\n__Zodiac Sign:__ Leo  \n__Blood Type:__ O    \n\nMilly Ashford is the granddaughter of the school superintendent, Ruben K.

Milly enjoys teasing Shirley and is eager to discover Lelouch\'s weaknesses — enough so to rally the entire school into chasing after Arthur when she suspects the cat to hold something precious to him. She is secretly in love with Lelouch, but realizes the need to restore her family\'s status by marrying a noble.    ~!Milly is aware of Lelouch\'s identity as a former prince of Britannia, her family having supported Empress Marianne. In the second picture drama special included on the DVD release, her grandfather and Nina\'s grandfather are said to have worked on the Io and Ganymede Knightmare Frames together. Marianne\'s assassination led to the family\'s nobility status being stripped. The Ashfords arrange for Milly to marry Earl Lloyd Asplund to restore it. After the events of the first season, Milly remains a student on campus because she failed her examinations, although it is noted that she did so on purpose to remain on campus with her friends. She eventually earns enough credits to graduate and becomes a weather forecaster on the local TV news.

She develops a relationship with Suzaku Kururugi, whose views reflect her own, and eventually appoints him as her personal Knight.    ~!Towards the end of the first season, she announces her intent to form the Special Administrative Zone of Japan in the region under Mount Fuji, giving the Japanese people their name and country back. During the administration changeover ceremony, she falls under the accidental influence of Lelouch\'s Geass and is compelled to kill the Japanese people. She is shot by Zero to stop the ensuing chaos and dies from her injuries, sparking the Black Rebellion.

She also doesn\'t age. Apart from her immortality, C.C. has the ability to bestow people with the power of Geass, which manifests differently in each person but generally carries the ability to affect the minds of those it is used on in some way. The Geass sigil glows on her forehead whenever she manifests this power, and she has a similar scar on her left breast. It is hinted that many more like her exist, as shown in her memories of many children with similar sigils, and she suggests that the power has precipitated bloody conflicts in the past. Her powers caught the interest of Britannia, who imprisoned her for experimentation purposes.<br>\n\n~!Before she gained the power of Geass, C.C. was a ten-year old escaped slave. A church nun gave C.C. the power of Geass, making everyone around her fall in love with her. Once C.C.\'s power evolved to its highest point and she grew tired of all the proposals and gifts, the nun transferred her immortality to C.C., allowing her to die while leaving C.C. in the position of repeating the cycle.  In the first season finale, C.C. triggers a trap set by V.V., causing herself and Lelouch to be submerged in a shock image sequence similar to the one she used on Suzaku. Through this, Lelouch sees memories of her past, including repeated \"deaths\". One shows C.C. attempting to escape from a battlefield, only to be shot in the forehead. Further memories show her being persecuted as a witch and suffering various forms of torture and/or execution throughout history and various time periods, including burning at the stake, guillotining, and the iron maiden. This would suggest a minimum lifespan of at least six centuries. In a special feature included in the series\' fifth DVD, she and Lelouch discuss Washington\'s Rebellion, during which she speaks of participants such as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin as if she had been close friends with both. In the past, she appears to have observed Suzaku and Lelouch when they were both children, having even interacted with Lelouch at one point, though he doesn\'t remember their meeting.!~<br>\n\nHer individual experiences have led C.C. to become a detached and lonely individual, with little care for even those she has entered into contracts with, while in the past she was somewhat a spoiled and cheerful girl. She tells Lelouch that she has been alive so long that she can no longer remember who loves her and who hates her. Due to her nature and history, she has been lonely as long as she can remember. Lelouch replies, \"You\'re not alone. We are partners. If you are a witch, then I shall become a warlock.\" Lelouch is possibly the first person that has ever truly cared for her and it appears that she reciprocates at least some of these feelings, as she unexpectedly kisses him after their memories are shared.<br>\n\nC.C. has a strong penchant for pizza, especially Pizza Hut\'s (which sponsors the show in Japan, though the logo is blurred out in the English dub); she constantly orders pizzas to Lelouch\'s house using his credit card. She also carries around a stuffed toy of \"Cheese-kun\", the company\'s mascot in Japan. Her love of pizza is often used for comedic effect, as she was twice willing to risk capture simply to get a piece of a giant pizza being made by the Student Council (which is ruined both times); she doesn\'t trust Lelouch to retrieve it for her. Both Lelouch and Kallen sometimes refer to her as \"Pizza Girl\".<br>\n\n~!When left alone, she has sometimes spoken to a previously unknown person through means unknown, which, in episode 23, was revealed to be Marianne, Lelouch\'s deceased mother, although in episode 19 it appears that she is talking to V.V. as well.

Li is a member of the Chinese Federation. He possesses a sword, which he always carries with him. He is also fiercely loyal to the Empress, a trait not shared by any of his superiors. It seems that part of his goal is to reestablish the throne of China as the clear authority, as the current Empress is the head of a puppet government, with eunuchs holding actual power in the country.  Li was formerly a bodyguard for the influential eunuch Gaohai, and accompanied him when he was sent by the Federation as a consul to the Britannian colony Area 11. They arrive right as the Order of the Black Knight\'s operation to recover Zero began. The Black Knights succeed in their mission and Zero orders the Knights to head to the Chinese Embassy for protection. Gaohai, under the influence of Lelouch\'s Geass, agrees to harbor the fugitives, which troubles Li as this is not part of their mission.  He meets Karen Kōzuki and is impressed that someone of her age is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki. Later, as the Britannians wait to kill the imprisoned Black Knights, he attacks the embassy himself in an attempt to further his own plans and ideals. After the initial attack, Li holds a private conversation between himself, Karen, and C.C.. He informs them that he plans to kill Gaohai. Under threat by Li, C.C. agrees to let it look like Gaohai died when fighting with them.  Li confronts Gaohai about having recognized the United States of Japan without confirming it with higher officials in the mainland, including the Empress. When he finds out that Gaohai, who is still affected by the Geass, cares more about Zero than the Empress, Li summarily executes Gaohai for committing lèse majesté. C.C. realizes his ambitions, and that his agreement to aid the Order of the Black Knights is only in return for the Black Knights being used as a tool to aid his own plans for China.  Li is in top physical condition and is exceptionally skilled in close combat, especially with swords. He is capable of drawing his blade, striking, and sheathing it without his victims perceiving the blade being drawn or Li moving. It is also rumored that Xingke will pilot the Shen-Hu.  Li Xingke has been described as \"strong as Suzaku\", he\'s also been described as \"smart as Lelouch\". He is able to quickly discern that Karen Kōzuki is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki Knightmare Frame.  Li displays his intelligence when he deals with the escalating diplomatic and military situation that evolves around the Chinese Federation Consulate sheltering the Order of the Black Knights from Britannia.

She is a member of the swimming club. She admits to being infatuated with Lelouch since his enrollment on campus, but finds it extremely hard to get his attention. She has a habit of jumping to conclusions before people can explain things to her, particularly when Lelouch is concerned. Shirley was awarded 19th place in the 29th Anime Grand Prix for Favorite Female Character.    ~!Shirley has a major role in the middle of the first season. After the Black Knights, led by Lelouch\'s alter ego Zero, indirectly cause the death of her father during the Battle of Narita, Villetta Nu suggests that Lelouch may be involved with the Black Knights, so Shirley follows him and discovers that he is in fact Zero. When Villetta covertly follows her and attempts to arrest Lelouch, Shirley shoots her to protect him. She tries to write a letter about her feelings on the situation to Lelouch, only to throw it aside. Mao uses his mind-reading Geass to manipulate her into killing Lelouch, but she cannot bring herself to do so. To alleviate her suffering, Lelouch uses his Geass to erase Shirley\'s memories of him. Lelouch expresses regret for having to do so, and even quietly suggests that he might have loved her. Shirley rediscovers her letter near the end of the first season, but cannot confront Lelouch about it because of the rebellion that takes place.   In the second season, Shirley\'s memories, along with the rest of Ashford\'s Student Council, have been rewritten by the Emperor, erasing her memories of Zero\'s identity for the second time. Her affection for Lelouch has returned over the intermidiate year. Her memories are restored by Jeremiah Gottwald\'s Geass Canceller.   After coming to terms with it, she comes to understand Lelouch\'s motivations and forgives him after realizing that he is alone in his quest. She resolves to support him as the one true thing in his life, but runs into Rolo; when she mentions that she wants to help Lelouch reunite with Nunnally, he mortally wounds her. She confesses her feelings to Lelouch when he finds her, and dies in his arms despite Lelouch\'s desperate attempts to command her to live.

She develops an obsessive crush on the Third Princess Euphemia after the latter helps her during a traumatizing hostage incident at the Lake Kawaguchi Convention Center Hotel. She subsequently comes to rely on Euphemia for emotional support.   ~!Lloyd Asplund is interested in Nina\'s personal research regarding the possibility of using Uranium-235 as a fuel, even providing her with some sakuradite to further her research. Following Euphemia\'s death, Nina becomes emotionally and mentally unstable. In a misguided attempt to kill Zero and avenge the princess, she arms the Ashford\'s Ganymede Knightmare Frame with a prototype nuclear reactor, intending to detonate it and take out all of Tokyo. !~  ~!It fails to explode, however.   Nina is eventually recruited by Second Prince Schneizel as chief of his \"In Vogue\" research team headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Schneizel seems to keep her stable by reminding her of how Euphemia would act, though her bitterness towards Zero is not forgotten. Under him, she eventually creates a working bomb. The bomb, codenamed F.L.E.I.J.A. (Field Limitary Effective Implosion Armament, pronounced \"Freya\"), vaporizes everything within a specific radius. The one used on Tokyo obliterates everything within eight kilometers, while another used on the Britannian capital of Pendragon destroys everything within 100 kilometers. Nina is devastated by the destruction caused by her weapon, which causes more than 35 million casualties when fired on Tokyo Settlement. Lloyd tells her that she\'ll have to become detached if she intends to continue being a scientist.

Before the Britannia Empire conquered Area 11, Kallen\'s original name was Karen Kouzuki. She comes from a prestigious family and attends the Ashford Academy where she receives outstanding grades while serving as a member of its Student Council. When away from the Academy, she fights as an anti-Britannian operative. Also, Kallen helped organize the Black Knights.   Her brother, Naoto Kouzuki (紅月ナオト Kōzuki Naoto?), with whom she had a deep connection, was a former leader of her resistance cell before his death.  Both Kallen\'s stepmother, a Britannian, and biological mother live with her in the same house, but her biological mother is employed as a maid and is often mistreated by both her stepmother and Kallen herself. After her biological mother is arrested for using Refrain (a fictional drug which lets people think they\'re reliving the past), Kallen changes her views and decides to fight against the Britannian Empire not only for her brother, but to fulfill her new wish for a world in which she can live happily with her biological mother.  Frail and meek, this aspect of Kallen\'s character was used as a public front to mask her true nature as well as hide her involvement in the resistance.  Kallen leads a double life as a normal Britannian student and as a member of a guerrilla resistance group against Britannia, which is later reformed into the Order of the Black Knights by Lelouch Lamperouge. In school, she portrays herself as a weak-bodied high school student who obeys all of the formalities, and goes by her Britannian name of Stadtfeld. However, her personality changes in to a very strong-willed and forceful one when she acts as a resistance fighter.  As a running gag, Kallen ends up nude or immodestly dressed in front of other people on numerous occasions: Lelouch sees her naked after she pulls back a shower curtain in surprise in the third episode, Suzaku sees her bathing under a waterfall when they are stranded on Kaminejima, she is forced to dress in an immodest bunny costume at the start of the second season (to plant a tracking device on Lelouch), and she walks in on a meeting between C.C. and the Chinese ambassadors wearing only a towel when intending to complain about the previous situation to C.C. (claiming that the operation would\'ve gone faster if C.C. was wearing the outfit).  In an interview reported by the anime magazine Newtype USA, seiyu Ami Koshimizu talked about the difficulty of voicing Kallen because of the double life that her character leads.

A brilliant thinker who is quite talented at chess, he lives with his younger sister, Nunnally, with their maid, Sayoko Shinozaki, at a house situated within the compounds of Ashford Academy, where they are looked after by the Ashford family.  Lelouch is soon swept into the conflict between the Britannia Empire and the pockets of resistance which oppose it when he accidentally boards a truck being used by Japanese resistance operatives. Within the truck is a capsule holding C.C., who sacrifices herself to save him from the military forces trying to recapture her. When it seems as if her sacrifice was pointless, C.C. suddenly touches his hand and offers him the \"Power of the King\", the mythical power of Geass. The Geass manifests itself in him as the power of absolute obedience, which allows him to make people obey his orders without question.   With his new power, Lelouch begins his rebellion against the Empire, forming the Order of the Black Knights and takes up the identity of Zero to lead them, becoming a revolutionary and gaining popular support amongst the people.   ~!Lelouch is the son of the Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia, and the late Imperial Consort Marianne, making Lelouch the eleventh prince of the Britannian Imperial Family. He was seventeenth in line for the throne prior to his mother\'s assassination and his sister\'s crippling in the same incident. A ten year old Lelouch confronted the Emperor afterward and accused him of leaving his mother defenseless, even going as far as renouncing his entitlement to the throne. In response, his father banished him to Japan, where he was used as a political hostage in the Sakuradite conflict.  It was during his stay at the Kururugi household that he first met Suzaku Kururugi, with whom the young Lelouch did not interact initially in a friendly manner, before later becoming friends. However, when Britannia finally developed its Knightmare Frames fleet and decided to invade Japan to seize control of the Sakuradite mines, consequently discarding Lelouch\'s use as a diplomatic tool, Lelouch, fearing for his and his sister\'s safety, hid their true identities and sought the help of the Ashford family, who were his mother\'s allies.  His mother\'s death and his father\'s apparent lack of concern in regards to it were huge blows to Lelouch. He always felt that it was unfair for both his mother and sister, and therefore made it his goal to pursue a better world for Nunnally. He also seeks to discover the true reason for his mother\'s death, as she was murdered in the Aries Imperial Palace, a place terrorists would be unlikely to penetrate successfully without being noticed, if at all.  Shortly after gaining the power of Geass from C.C., Lelouch assumes the secret identity Zero, a mysterious, masked revolutionary dressed in a black helmet and cloak. The helmet has a retractable plate over the left eye so Lelouch can use his Geass. In this guise, he forms the Order of the Black Knights, initially composed of the members of Kallen Kōzuki\'s resistance group. The goal of this vigilante group is a campaign against powerful individuals who oppress the helpless, which he eventually expands into reforming Japan as an independent nation.  Lelouch is willing to do whatever it takes to accomplish his goal, even if it means lying to his followers and using people as bait for the outcome he desires. However, he has trouble putting those he is close to in harms way for the sake of his goal, which is a weakness as a commander but a remnant of his humanity and sanity. His feelings for Nunnally in particular often hinders his plans, particularly at the end of the first season, where he abandons a massive war with Britannian forces to rescue her. Gradually, however, he has come to embrace the fact that he has to destroy before reconstruction can occur, even if it means harming those he cares about.  Originally, Lelouch is motivated by the desire to avenge his mother\'s death and construct an ideal world where his sister Nunnally can live in peace. After Nunnally becomes Viceroy of Area 11, and her wishes conflict with his goals, his friends help him to realize that his rebellion is no longer just for Nunnally, but for all the people of the world. Following Nunnally\'s death and the betrayal of the Black Knights, Lelouch focuses on making sure that he at least takes the Emperor down with him.  The turning point in his rebellion comes when Euphemia li Britannia declares the region under Mount Fuji the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, giving the Japanese people their name and country back, albeit in a much smaller area. This effectively destroys any possibility of the Black Knights\' rebellion; acceptance would render them powerless and refusal would make them pariahs. Lelouch confronts her at the opening ceremony and tries to have her shoot him, hoping to make himself a martyr. When she says she plans to give up her title, he surrenders and agrees to work with her. However, at this moment his Geass permanently activates, and an offhand comment about ordering her to kill the Japanese forces her to do just that. Lelouch reluctantly kills her and uses the massacre as an excuse to declare Japan an independent nation. He then leads an attack on the Tokyo Settlement. The attack goes well at first, but when Lelouch learns that Nunnally has been kidnapped, he abandons the battle, leaving his forces helpless against the much better organized Britannian forces.  Lelouch and C.C. make their way to Kaminejima to search for Nunnally, where Lelouch is confronted by Suzaku Kururugi. Lelouch attempts to broker a truce, but Suzaku is distraught over the death of Euphemia and refuses to listen. An angered Lelouch draws his pistol and both Lelouch and Suzaku attempt to shoot one another. A single gunshot is heard as the screen fades to black at the end of the first season.!~  Season Two:  ~!One year later, Lelouch is living a peaceful life with his younger brother, Rolo Lamperouge, and has no memory of his revolutionary activities, his Geass, Nunnally, his mother, or his royal lineage. Flashbacks reveal that neither Suzaku or Lelouch managed to kill one another. Instead, Lelouch was apprehended and brought before the Emperor, who used his own Geass to wipe Lelouch\'s memories and suppress his power.  Lelouch\'s memories and Geass are restored by C.C., and he resumes leadership of the Black Knights. To prevent retaliation by the Britannian forces, he makes his base in the Chinese Federation\'s consulate. When Nunnally is appointed as Viceroy of Area 11, and announces her plans to reestablish the Special Administrative Zone of Japan, Lelouch falls into depression since he would be impeding her wishes by continuing his rebellion. He nearly begins taking Refrain before Kallen stops him. With the help of Kallen and his friends at the Ashford Academy, Lelouch realizes that his mission no longer revolves solely around Nunnally, but concerns the rest of his friends, and the Japanese people as well. To solve both concerns, Lelouch engineers the legal exile of the Black Knights by getting the Britannians to agree to exile Zero in exchange for bringing one million participants for Nunnally\'s new Japan. By having them all dress as Zero, he forces Suzaku to exile them all rather than order a massacre. Sayoko stays behind as his body double to keep up the illusion that Lelouch and Zero are separate people, though during her short tenure as his impersonator she changes his image into that of an athletic womanizer.  The Black Knights escape to the Chinese Federation, where Lelouch begins his plans to win more countries to his side, creating a alliance that can match the Britannian Empire. He starts by overthrowing the High Eunuchs of the Chinese Federation and returning control to Empress Tianzi. He also has a secondary motive in doing so: the Chinese Federation is where V.V.\'s Geass Directorate is headquartered. By taking control of the directorate, Lelouch believes he will be able to match the Emperor in both military and Geass might. While the remaining dissident forces are cleaned up, Lelouch returns to Japan to prepare for the invasion by installing Gefjun Disturbers in the mass transit rail system. The combined effect of every train running a Disturber would shut down Tokyo Settlement completely.  After Shirley is killed by Rolo, Lelouch abandons his plan to take over the Geass Directorate, instead mounting an all-out assault on their stronghold. He orders the deaths of everyone within, resulting in the death of General Bartley among countless others. V.V. tries to use the Siegfried to buy time for the remaining members to escape, but it is destroyed with the aid of Cornelia while C.C. annihilates the remaining followers. Lelouch chases V.V. back into the temple, where he is unexpectedly teleported to the Sword of Akasha to face the Emperor. Lelouch attempts to kill the Emperor, but he has become immortal like C.C. The Emperor tells Lelouch about the world\'s lies, and shortly after C.C. arrives, finally revealing the contents of their pact. She would have had Lelouch kill her and take on her immortality, but instead spares him by placing him inside her memories while the Emperor kills her. Lelouch refuses to let her die unhappy and convinces her to live on. Lelouch destroys part of the Sword of Akasha and is transported back to the real world with C.C., but her memories of her life after gaining Geass have been erased.  Lelouch then completes ratifying the United Federation of Nations, and their first act is to liberate Japan. To insure Nunnally\'s safety, Lelouch agrees to meet Suzaku alone at the Kururugi Shrine. Suzaku demands answers about Lelouch\'s various uses of Geass, but Lelouch lies, claiming that everything he has ever done was purely for selfish reasons. Suzaku realizes that Lelouch is lying and agrees to help, but Prince Schneizel\'s troops move in to arrest Lelouch, convincing him that Suzaku sold him out. Lelouch escapes with the help of Guilford, having used his Geass to make Guilford see him as Princess Cornelia, and uses the Gefjun Disturber trains to shut down Tokyo Settlement. He resolves to abandon his emotions in order to achieve his goals, having lost his faith in friendship.  In the second battle of Tokyo, Lelouch directs his forces to focus on the government building in an effort to secure Nunnally. Suzaku threatens to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb unless Lelouch stands down, but Lelouch merely waves him off as a liar. Once Kallen escapes in her upgraded Guren and Suzaku becomes an obstacle, Lelouch orders her to kill him. As her Knightmare is far more advanced, she nearly succeeds. Suzaku\'s imminent defeat activates his Geass command, causing him to launch F.L.E.I.J.A. The bomb engulfs the government complex, killing Nunnally among countless others. Lelouch goes into a nervous breakdown at the thought, refusing to believe that Nunnally could be dead. His identity is then exposed by Schneizel and the Black Knights betray him. Rolo evacuates him, but dies in the attempt. In the end, Lelouch comes to terms with his feelings for Rolo. Having lost everything as retribution for his acts, he realizes that the last thing he must do is drag his father into hell with him.  With his renewed purpose, Lelouch quickly sets off to defeat the Emperor, throwing the Britannian ranks into chaos by using his Geass to make numerous soldiers slaves to his will. As the Britannian forces battle one another, Lelouch confronts the Emperor in the Sword of Akasha, sealing the entrance behind him so they will both be trapped for eternity.!~  Geass:  Lelouch\'s Geass, given to him by C.C., grants him \"the power of absolute obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person\'s mind upon eye contact which they will obey without question. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated in this state are written into the minds of the designated targets once the sigil projects from his eye to theirs. Lelouch could initially toggle Geass activation at will, but subsequently loses this control to an affliction known as Geass runaway.   ~!In the second season, C.C. gives Lelouch a contact lens that blocks his Geass, but indicates that his Geass will eventually grow powerful enough to render it ineffective.!~  Of all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch\'s has been explored the most, and also seems to have the most restrictions and side effects of any Geass introduced.      * Commands must be issued verbally.     * The victim must make direct eye contact for commands to be issued. The maximum effective distance is 270 meters. Line of sight via a reflective surface is sufficient for the effect to occur.     * Commands may be issued only once to any given individual, but any number of commands may be issued at initial application so long as eye contact is unbroken. Since Jeremiah\'s Geass Canceller negates all Geass effects, those exposed to it may be commanded once again.     * The victim will not perform any action disallowed by their physical or mental capabilities, though they will try to carry out the command to the best of their ability. For example, a victim will not be able to correctly answer a question they don\'t know the answer to, but will direct the user to someone who can if they are able. However, commands that affect the mind or consciousness, such as telling the victim to forget something, will take effect despite the fact that the victim could not normally force themselves to do so.     * An action will be carried out for as long as dictated in its command, or upon the indicated conditional circumstance. Eye contact does not need to be maintained for command execution to occur. No upper limit has been established, but the conditional command Lelouch gives Suzaku is still in effect more than a year later.     * The victim\'s memories for the duration of command issue and execution are sealed and cannot be recalled.     * A victim may resist a commanded action to some degree if it is utterly repugnant to them.  So long as the above conditions are met, commands may be issued to anybody besides those who have gained the power of immortality and to any number of individuals at once. Those under the effect of Geass have a red outline on their pupils, presumably a visual cue for the viewer since the characters never point it out.  Even without his Geass, Lelouch is a formidable opponent. He is highly intelligent, possessing a genius-level intellect, and is capable of devising and executing strategies with incredible speed and precision. Rolo notes that operating the Absolute Defense Territory of the Shinkirō requires complex calculations which he cannot perform, while Lelouch almost makes it look easy. In the audio dramas, Suzaku says that, when they were children, Lelouch devised a secret sign language containing over 500 words.  Lelouch is quick to deduce facts from simple clues. In episode 14, when Mao says C.C.\'s name, Lelouch instantly comes up with fourteen different possibilities for Mao\'s identity, including the correct one. Lelouch is also able to predict the Lancelot\'s actions exactly through his study of their past battles, allowing Kallen and the Four Holy Swords to almost defeat it (only Suzaku\'s reflexes saved his life).  Lelouch is also charismatic and persuasive; as Zero, he is able to win the support of much of Japan\'s population through well-delivered speeches combined with his ability to make miracles in almost any situation through his superior tactical planning. Mao repeatedly praises Lelouch\'s persuasive talent, and V.V. remarks that Lelouch is \"a lot like his father.\"  Physically, Lelouch is underwhelming. He possesses the physical prowess of a teenager who engages in little to no strenuous physical activity. Thus, one of Lelouch\'s traits is the inability to run very fast or for any substantial period of time. Within the series, this is usually played for comedic effect, as Lelouch is constantly outpaced by his classmates in every situation, and even the most simple tasks requiring manual labor exhaust him before he manages to accomplish anything significant. This joke is taken to its logical conclusion in the second season, where it is revealed that Lelouch is supposed to attend remedial physical education classes, but skips them as often as possible. This creates problems when Sayoko poses as Lelouch: she is a master of martial arts, and hence far more athletic than Lelouch himself. Lelouch laments the problem and decides to have Sayoko attend his gym classes to fix it.  Lelouch is also shown to be very talented at most domestic skills, including cooking and sewing; it has been stated that this comes as a result of his taking care of himself and Nunnally for seven years. He has been shown to be an excellent cook, and is usually the one cooking the food for parties held by the Student Council, both because the others (except Milly) are terrible cooks and nobody else can meet his exacting requirements (such as measuring ingredients to three significant decimals).  Lelouch also has some skill with firearms, usually brandishing a Britannian pistol when threatening someone. His Knightmare piloting skill has been shown to be proficient but not exceptional; he is a capable pilot by himself, though he tends to be overwhelmed by Suzaku and other pilots with more advanced Knightmares at their disposal. When Lelouch pilots a standard Knightmare on the battlefield, he is typically accompanied by Kallen, who is an elite Knightmare pilot and the leader of his personal squad, Squad Zero.    ~!After stealing the Gawain, Lelouch co-pilots it with C.C., controlling the weapons and command functions while C.C. handles navigation and flight. After the Black Knights are exiled from Japan, Lelouch pilots the Shinkirō, which has the most powerful defense of any Knightmare.!~   ~!At the end of season 2, Lelouch ordered Suzaku to kill him so that his sins and all the people\'s hatred will disappear and he will be free. Killing him will be a key to future happiness.

She holds the distinction of being the youngest individual ever appointed to the Knights of Rounds at the age of 15. She wants to be remembered, so she maintains a blog which she frequently updates with pictures she takes with her camera-phone.   As one of the younger members of the Kights of Rounds, she is close friends with Suzaku Kururugi and Gino Weinberg. Suzaku\'s cat Arthur also takes a liking to her, though it seems to be more affectionate to everyone except Suzaku himself.   Anya maintains a detached attitude in most situations, usually declaring most things to be boring. In battle, her fighting style reflects her heavily-armored Knightmare; she annihilates her enemies with overwhelming force and doesn\'t hesitate to kill disabled enemies. However, this detached attitude also gives her a lack of common sense; she had piloted her personal Knightmare Frame just for the sake of capturing Lelouch’s hat to gain extra club budgets, disregarding the fact that she was piloting her Mordred in a non-combat area and had aroused the suspicion of the Knight Police, as well as forgetting the fact that she is to be a couple with Lelouch if she gets his hat.   It is later revealed that she updates her blog because she doesn\'t trust her own memories, as she has numerous blog entries over nine years old which she doesn\'t remember writing as well as discrepancies between her blog and her memories.    ~!Suzaku speculates that she is under the influence of Geass. It is explained that these occurrences are being caused by Marianne, whose spirit has been lying dormant within Anya. Marianne takes over her body as a means to reach Charles, eventually leaving Anya\'s body.  She faces off against Jeremiah Gottwald and manages to destroy the outer body of the Sutherland Sieg. However, Jeremiah uses the Sutherland stored inside in a kamikaze attack, which heavily damages the Mordred. He is prepared to kill Anya, but when she makes mention of having no memories, Jeremiah realizes that she is under the influence of Geass and restores her memories. In the epilogue, the two are seen tending to an orange farm together.!~','2020-10-19 11:25:01','2020-10-19 11:25:01','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/11476.jpg','MC'),(430,'Sayoko Shinozaki','Age: 24 \nBirthday: November 9 \nZodiac Sign: Scorpio \nBlood Type: O  \n\nSayoko Shinozaki is a kindhearted Japanese woman who serves as a maid to the Lamperouge siblings in their residence. She was originally Milly Ashford\'s personal maid, but was reassigned to Lelouch and Nunnally when they were placed under the Ashfords\' care. Her relatively benign appearance contrasts with her position as the 37th successor of the Shinozaki School of martial arts. She is a highly skilled martial artist and has matching athletic talents. She keeps a number of kunai strapped to her thighs and carries smoke bombs. She is referred to as a supermaid on her official profile. The DVD releases for the series occasionally promote a segment called \"Sayoko\'s Diary\", which depicts her humorously slanted view of daily life at the Ashford Academy.  Sayoko assists in taking care of Nunnally whenever Lelouch is not around. She is later employed by Diethard Reid as a spy for the Black Knights, and escapes capture during the Black Rebellion by leaving for the Chinese Federation with Diethard and several other members. Lelouch reveals his secret identity to her in the second season, and she poses as his double at Ashford while he is away. Though she is able to play the part somewhat convincingly, her aforementioned slanted viewpoint of his daily life leads her to believe that he is a womanizer, and she portrays him as such. Furthermore, she also rather openly displays her athletic prowess during one of Milly\'s festivals, another contrast with the physically unfit Lelouch. Due to this, Lelouch has decided that Sayoko is to pose as him during all physical ed lessons.','2020-10-19 11:25:01','2020-10-19 11:25:01','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/1807.jpg','MC'),(431,'Xingke Li','Li briefly appeared in episode 23 of season one and made his full debut in the first episode of R2. Li is a member of the Chinese Federation. He possesses a sword, which he always carries with him. He is also fiercely loyal to the Empress, a trait not shared by any of his superiors. It seems that part of his goal is to reestablish the throne of China as the clear authority, as the current Empress is the head of a puppet government, with eunuchs holding actual power in the country.  Li was formerly a bodyguard for the influential eunuch Gaohai, and accompanied him when he was sent by the Federation as a consul to the Britannian colony Area 11. They arrive right as the Order of the Black Knight\'s operation to recover Zero began. The Black Knights succeed in their mission and Zero orders the Knights to head to the Chinese Embassy for protection. Gaohai, under the influence of Lelouch\'s Geass, agrees to harbor the fugitives, which troubles Li as this is not part of their mission.  He meets Karen Kōzuki and is impressed that someone of her age is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki. Later, as the Britannians wait to kill the imprisoned Black Knights, he attacks the embassy himself in an attempt to further his own plans and ideals. After the initial attack, Li holds a private conversation between himself, Karen, and C.C.. He informs them that he plans to kill Gaohai. Under threat by Li, C.C. agrees to let it look like Gaohai died when fighting with them.  Li confronts Gaohai about having recognized the United States of Japan without confirming it with higher officials in the mainland, including the Empress. When he finds out that Gaohai, who is still affected by the Geass, cares more about Zero than the Empress, Li summarily executes Gaohai for committing lèse majesté. C.C. realizes his ambitions, and that his agreement to aid the Order of the Black Knights is only in return for the Black Knights being used as a tool to aid his own plans for China.  Li is in top physical condition and is exceptionally skilled in close combat, especially with swords. He is capable of drawing his blade, striking, and sheathing it without his victims perceiving the blade being drawn or Li moving. It is also rumored that Xingke will pilot the Shen-Hu.  Li Xingke has been described as \"strong as Suzaku\", he\'s also been described as \"smart as Lelouch\". He is able to quickly discern that Karen Kōzuki is the pilot of the Guren Nishiki Knightmare Frame.  Li displays his intelligence when he deals with the escalating diplomatic and military situation that evolves around the Chinese Federation Consulate sheltering the Order of the Black Knights from Britannia. In addition to not provoking the Britannians to cause an international crisis or possible war, he also uses the unforeseen situation to his advantage to advance his goals and kill the eunuch Gaohai. He also seems to be able to appreciate Zero\'s intelligence and wit.

Shidoh has a great liking for chocolate. Since Shidoh has neglected to kill people and extend his own lifetime, he probably did not notice that his Note is stolen. As the end of his lifetime approaches, Shidoh finds Ryuk and learns that Mello is in possession of his Note. Later, he finds Snyder in the human world.

Of the successors, Near is the more level-headed, calmly assessing the situation, while the other, Mello, is more emotional and quick to act. Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L\'s methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice. Near uses the Wedding Text font \"N\" and \"L\" to represent himself and the fake L, respectively. But later in the aftermath, he used Old English font \"L\" like the original L did.

Ohba said that a negative reaction originated from \"the difference in their attitudes\" and that people may have viewed Near as \"a cheat.\" Ohba added that Near\'s \"cheeky behavior,\" intended to \"reinforce his childishness,\" had been construed as \"annoying.\"  In the final chapter Near brings finger puppets to the Yellow Box Warehouse. Takeshi Obata, artist of Death Note, said that Near first bought the Kira finger puppet and drew on it with a magic marker. Obata then said that Near must have created the other puppets afterwards. Obata views Near as not liking L much so Obata had Near depict L as \"ugly\", and that Near \"worked hard\" on Mello\'s puppet as Near \"liked Mello.\"  Obata said he enjoyed drawing Near and that Near is also one of his favorite and his least favorite characters, considering him to be the smartest character in the manga \"because he cheats.\"  When asked about which character was most similar to himself, Ohba indicated Near and \"maybe Light.\" Regarding Near, Ohba said that he does not leave his house often.','2020-10-19 11:25:07','2020-10-19 11:25:07','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n464-6KeJpU6g7Hwj.jpg','MC'),(459,'Mary Kenwood','__Birthday:__ November 2  \n\n Wedy, real name Mary Kenwood, is a professional burglar in the employ of L.

Since then he has searched the earth and created countless demons, even the Etherious so that he may somehow die, however he has been unsuccessful. The time Zeref has spend under the curse of contradiction has slowly begun to take its toll on Zerefs mind, and he has begun to develop symptoms of a split personality, one personality being his original kind self, but the other being a mage who believes humans no longer deserve to live (as they have repeated the same mistakes of useless fighting and wars over and over throughout the many years he’s been alive).!~\n~!Over his many years, Zeref had encountered Fairy Tails first master Mavis on multiple occasions.

In fact most dark guilds were founded and operate under the pretense of reviving Zeref, and helping him to conquer the world. Not only was he an incredibly strong mage, but he was also regarded as a genius, and he used his immense intellect to try to research and discover new magic, regardless of his status as the most powerful human alive. He is also responsible for the creation of tens of thousands of demons by means of his living magic, and these demons continue to roam the earth, leaving trails of destruction behind them. Aside from living magic, Zeref was also a skilled user of death magic.\n~!At an unspecified point in time, Zeref created the Alvarez empire, which is an empire comprised of all 730 magic guilds of Alakitasia that Zeref brought together by means of martial force.

He then proceeded to study magic at Mildian Magic Academy where he studied the connections between life, death, and magic in the hopes of resurrecting his lost brother. He continued to study this and created the R-System and Eclipse Gate against the wishes of his superiors, who feared the wrath of Ankhseram (the god of life and death). At the time, he was a very caring and smart boy, but then Ankhseram cursed Zeref with the curse of contradiction (the more he values human life, the more the people around him will die), as well as immortality. Since then he has searched the earth and created countless demons, even the Etherious so that he may somehow die, however he has been unsuccessful. The time Zeref has spend under the curse of contradiction has slowly begun to take its toll on Zerefs mind, and he has begun to develop symptoms of a split personality, one personality being his original kind self, but the other being a mage who believes humans no longer deserve to live (as they have repeated the same mistakes of useless fighting and wars over and over throughout the many years he’s been alive).!~\n~!Over his many years, Zeref had encountered Fairy Tails first master Mavis on multiple occasions. They took a liking to each other, with Mavis denying Zerefs claim that he was a monster exactly like the legends of him say. Mavis was eventually placed under the very same curse as him, and she grew into an unstable mind set. Zeref attempted to comfort her when she told him of this, and they decided to live together to search for a way to end the curse. They had fallen in love, but as they shared their first kiss, the curse of contradiction took effect, with Zerefs curse becoming the dominant of the 2 and consequently, Mavis is killed. Zeref was emotionally scarred by the death of the woman he loved, and he embarked on his seemingly endless journey to find death once again.!~\n~!Zeref eventually found a way to revive his younger brother, Natsu, and in doing so, also created a demon with the potential to kill him like he wanted.

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed\'s primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn\'t seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al\'s suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4\'11\"), however his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed\'s ability to fight is not impaired, and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\n~!Born to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward\'s first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad\'s formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dear mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi\'s intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics to a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God\'s domain and peeking at the Gate\'s vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al\'s soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy\'s life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame alchemist Roy mustang came to the Rockbell\'s in res ponce to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother\'s body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automale. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automale at age 11 when it took most adults 3 years.!~','2020-10-19 11:26:10','2020-10-19 11:26:10','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n11-k3dR0ZXPTwLd.jpg','SC'),(712,'Van Hohenheim','He is the father of the protagonists, Edward and Alphonse Elric.

He worked in a lab, which took advantage of \'witch trials\' as human bait, to create the first philosopher\'s stone. He succeeded, but it cost him his life.

They continued this practice for many years, until Hohenheim fell in love and married Trisha Elric. After they sired Edward and Alphonse, he left for fear Dante would use them against him, and also because he felt ashamed of his past. Like Dante, his flesh is wearing away, so he must wear cologne to mask the scent. He can transmute without circles, because when he died, he saw past the gate, as did Dante. !~  He (in the manga and 2009 series) is...  ~! a human Philosopher\'s Stone.

However, at the last minute, Father lies about where the center of the circle is, and engulfs both himself and Hohenheim into the gate. Hohenheim wakes to see everybody in his country dead. He meets Homunculus, who tells him everything, how he has now gained half of the powers of the stone.

However, when he gets into the game, he becomes a different, more intimidating person, relishing the look of defeat on people\'s faces when they are denied. He has a high success rate with this blocking style due to his analytical skills and predictions, thus he is confident in his abilities . He also greatly values the fun aspect of volleyball.\n\n~!As an elementary student, he was called a monster for his looks also probably due to the meaning of his name (Satori refers to a Yokai) and was told he couldn\'t join the volleyball team by other students because of that. Using his guess block, he was able to block the spike of one of his bullies. This event made him feel happy and he continued to use his unique blocking technique to feel that way again despite much opposition until high school. Since his guess block got a lot of points, the Shiratorizawa coach let him join the team without resistance.!~','2020-10-19 11:26:34','2020-10-19 11:26:34','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b126073-MVwax8GNur2c.jpg','SC'),(797,'Tanji Washijou','Tanji is the head coach of Shiratorizawa Academy Boys\' Volleyball team.','2020-10-19 11:26:35','2020-10-19 11:26:35','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b137539-UYztRwNfKB26.png','SC'),(798,'Kiyoomi Sakusa','Itachiyama Academy\'s second year ace and one of the top three aces of Japan.

However it was his hesitance and ignorance about her feelings that caused tension in their friendship which led to her starting to date his friend Hisashi. He was one of the first people to notice that something was wrong in the school and quickly took action to escape with his friends. His relationship with Rei was shaken further when he was forced to kill her boyfriend after he was bitten and had turned into a zombie. Soon afterwards their relationship was amended. His resolve to protect Rei at all costs and everyone else in the group earned him their respect and admiration as a leader despite his own feelings of inadequacy. He often acts brash and will go out to risk his life to save or protect someone on a whim. Similar to Saeko, Takashi confessed that he\'s found an exhilaration in killing \"them\".

Both girls have good reasons to do so as we see him leaving behind a student who has sprained his ankle and even kicking him back towards a group of zombies chasing them. He then makes a speech about how weaklings do not deserve to exist. It was implied by Hirano that Shidō allowed bullies to beat him up as he watched with glee. It is assumed that the former&#039;s story is true because he pointed the nail gun at Shidō without blinking or hesitating to punch a nail wound to his face.    He has a desire to be a leader and some of the characters have theorized that he is trying to build a new religion with him on top as leader. Shidō is an apparent coward in the face of extreme danger, as seen when being threatened by a grazing head shot with a nail gun on Hirano&#039;s part, but nonetheless, proves to be a manipulative, villainous and sadistic character.    He is last seen by the main group when they abandon him on the bus, leaving him with only those willing to follow him. He reappears once more and is seen watching over an orgy between his followers on the bus at the end of Chapter 11, in a sort of Charles Manson-ish brainwashing (he allows his followers to do as they will, calling it &quot;free time&quot;). He seems to have a spy inside the base of humans set up at the mansion, who, as of Chapter 12, is relaying vital information about the morale of the people there. He is seen to keep his followers in line through intimidation, forcing them to follow him lest they incur his wrath or be left to fend for themselves. He sees the people that follow him as angels that will help usher in a new age, since they are youthful teenagers. Shidō then accuses one of the teens on board the bus of showing weakness, the boy having shown concern for the welfare of his family. He convinces the rest of the group to eject the &#039;weak link&#039; for the sake of the New World. Highlighting how far Shidō has turned the minds of his followers, they callously throw the teen off the bus, going so far as to bid him farewell as he attempts to get back on the bus, only to fail and be subsequently attacked by a zombie. The teen is later seen in his undead form in chapter 15 when the dead break into the estate.    Later on, his history and background with Rei was shown when his father was involved in Japanese politics and had Rei retained as a favor of getting back at his stepbrother. When threatened with a rifle-mounted bayonet by Rei, he seems scared witless until he realizes that no one would come to his aid before daring her to kill him. When she turns away and says that he is not even worth killing, his fury is shown. He is seen being ordered to leave the estate with the students he brought but ends up crashing into the forklift when the EMP Blast temporarily stopped the bus, removing the concrete blocks which served as the barrier against the undead. He recovers consciousness in time to see the undead horde advancing through the gap in the barrier. He is later seen at the elementary school where the evacuation is taking place.    \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n','2020-10-19 11:26:50','2020-10-19 11:26:50','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b32744-BQVEfAVbHWdL.png','SC'),(836,'Yuriko Takagi','Souichiro\'s wife and Saya\'s mother.

He never knew his father was alive, much less a hunter until he met [Kite](https://anilist.co/character/20594/Kite); a hunter who was also looking for Ging. From this point on, he became determined to find his father and decided to take the Hunter exam to do so. He became friends with [Killua](https://anilist.co/character/27/Killua-Zoldyck) almost instantly when they met at the Hunter exam. Gon\'s an innocent and naive boy who is willing to help anyone, especially his friends. He rarely ever looks at anything in a bad way. His curious and naive personality often frustrates his friends, but this is also the reason why many people are attracted to him. He is also from the enhancement nen group. He usually fights barehanded or with his fishing rod, but Gon\'s fist is usually more deadly than any weapon.\n\n##__Gon\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Jajanken__ (ジャジャン拳)\n-Rock (グー Gū)\nType: Enhancement\nRock is a close ranged attack, and has the highest power out of Gon\'s three Jajanken attacks, owing to his natural affinity for Enhancement. To perform it, Gon focuses aura in his fist with Ko, chanting as he readies the attack. If he has time to build up his Ren, the punch will be even more powerful. Rock is stronger than a normal Ko punch. According to [Knuckle](https://anilist.co/character/29809/Knuckle-Bine), this is because Gon takes risks by charging the attack and lowering his defenses, which leads to his aura output being increased for the duration of the ability. Gon was able to knock out Knuckle with this attack, despite the latter using Ko to defend himself, and also to send Hollow flying off into the distance (all the way to NGL, according to him). When gathering all his anger at [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou), Gon was able to summon such a great amount of aura that [Morel](https://anilist.co/character/29806/Morel-Mackernasey), the target of the ability, broke out in a cold sweat, later causing Gon to apologize because he thought the attack could kill him.\n\n-Scissors (チー Chī)\nType: Transmutation\nScissors, Gon\'s mid-ranged Jajanken attack, requires him to transmute his aura into a long blade which he extends from his outstretched middle and pointer fingers. With the advantage of surprise, it was able to cut through a defense that had been estimated to be able to counter Rock.\n\n-Paper (パー Pā)\nType: Emission\nPaper is Gon\'s long-ranged Jajanken attack. He uses his Emission skills to hurl aura from his open palm as a spherical projectile. Due to Gon being an Enhancer and Paper requiring Emission, a different Nen type, it has less than one-fourth of the power of Rock, despite the two abilities consuming the same amount of aura, although it can still pose a threat to less skilled Nen users. This ability can be useful for pincer type attacks.\n\n__Limitation Transformation__\nType: Unknown\nBy forming a Vow in a condition of immense emotional distress, Gon was able to summon \"all the power [he]\'ll ever have\", growing to an age where he could defeat [Neferpitou](https://anilist.co/character/12300/Neferpitou). His physical strength, Nen abilities, aura output and aura reserves increased immensely, to the point that the Royal Guard feared he might pose a threat to [Meruem](https://anilist.co/character/23277/Meruem) himself. Upon seeing him, Killua deduced it would normally take decades of training to reach that level of power. His heightened speed and reflexes allowed him to easily dodge Neferpitou\'s Terpsichora which pushed them beyond their limit. While in this state, Gon\'s single Ko kick was capable of throwing Neferpitou dozens of meters into the air, causing them to cough out blood, whereas they were left unscathed by [Isaac Netero](https://anilist.co/character/14489/Isaac-Netero)\'s attack. His first Jajanken blasted Neferpitou up the side of a hill and caused them to lose consciousness, although a few more were necessary to finally kill them.\nHowever, the price to pay was as great as the boost. Neferpitou guessed the ability had been possible only because an extraordinarily gifted individual willingly threw away his predisposition and compressed his life, predicting that Gon would never be able to utilize Nen again in the future. After the Royal Guard\'s death, Gon returned to his normal body and fell into a coma. His body soon started to decay, requiring constant life support, and he would have eventually died if not for [Nanika](https://anilist.co/character/52425/Alluka-Zoldyck)\'s intervention. Despite making a full recovery, Gon remained unable to see and use aura. According to his father, he simply \"went back to normal\", and should count himself lucky for getting off relatively scot-free. Going off Killua\'s fear that the more aura Gon used in that state, the harsher the backlash would be, it is possible that the transformation, on top of depriving Gon of the ability to use Nen, did not require his death per se, but that it shaved away a portion of his lifespan commensurate to the amount of power that Gon utilized while transformed. The repercussions are so severe that [Illumi](https://anilist.co/character/57/Illumi-Zoldyck) described Gon\'s Vow as being \"worse than death\", and Killua was confident any Exorcist would die on the spot trying to dispel it. His belief proved founded when the Hunter Association\'s only official Exorcist confirmed there was nothing she could do.\n\nIt is unknown what Nen types are involved in this ability. [Bill](https://anilist.co/character/138436/Bill)\'s Erigeron similarly entails the stimulation of growth and the increase of aura reserves, so it might be possible to speculate that Gon\'s transformation is an extreme form of Enhancement.!~','2020-10-19 11:26:54','2020-10-19 11:26:54','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b30-nlsZjuibeibo.jpg','SC'),(852,'Silva Zoldyck','Silva is Killua\'s father.

His deviousness and volatility have caused many opponents to have difficulty anticipating his next move, and this has led to him winning many battles. Using Shu powered poker cards as his primary weapon, he throws them with ease and deadly accuracy.  Also, he is very intrigued by [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) and the potential this young boy has to become an adept and powerful adversary. Hisoka, ever looking for a strong opponent, is willing to aid, or at least not defeat prematurely, someone that could develop into a future opponent.\n\n~!Later in the series, Hisoka is revealed to be a newly-inducted member of the Phantom Troupe, though his association with the organization is, rather characteristically, simply in order to fight a remarkable opponent. In actuality, his membership is a farce, a fact he reveals at an opportune time.!~\n\n##__Hisoka\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Bungee Gum__ (伸縮自在の愛 Elastic Love)\nType: Transmutation\nHisoka\'s main ability allows him to make his aura sticky and elastic. Its extreme durability, flexibility, and adhesive properties make it an exceptionally versatile ability with several offensive, defensive, and supplementary applications. He can activate it from his fingers, hands, and feet. He can attach it both through physical contact and remotely, by extending it towards the target, which makes it very difficult to avoid. He can give it the command to contract at will, and it snaps back with greater force the more it is stretched. It is so resilient that it did not tear after absorbing the full force of a ball hurled by [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) with Rock, or several of [Gotoh](https://anilist.co/character/60009/Gotoh)\'s coins, which makes it an effective way of returning projectiles to the sender.\nOffensively, Bungee Gum can be used to pull the opponent towards Hisoka or to create flail-like weapons. He can also separate it from his body, in which case it will tear after a maximum stretch of 10 meters. He most commonly detaches it from his body to attach projectiles to his opponent, such as his Shu-enhanced cards, while concealing it with In. The combination of the latter technique and Bungee Gum allows Hisoka to lay multi-layered traps that spring all at once, killing the unsuspecting opponent in a flash. He has also emitted it to restrain individuals as powerful as [Machi](https://anilist.co/character/5830/Machi-Komacine).\n\nBungee Gum also has a wide range of auxiliary applications. Hisoka can attach it to a solid surface to retreat at extreme speed when the need arises. By using it on his feet, he can adhere to the ground or run on walls. It is also useful for sticking objects in place for traps or to keep hold of them, even after throwing them. By covering a wound with it, he can instantly stop hemorrhages. On one occasion, he enveloped his lungs and heart with it so it would resuscitate him. By creating non-adhesive aura, he can also replace missing limbs, which can coil like a spring to propel himself at tremendous velocity.\n\n__Texture Surprise__ (薄っぺらな嘘 Flimsy Lies)\nType: Conjuration\nHisoka can apply his aura to any smooth, flat surface, such as paper or cloth, and manifest imagery on it to change its appearance and texture for deception. He can replicate over one thousand different textures. He has tricked Nen users of the Spiders\' caliber with this ability, with none of them realizing he had used it, either by sight or by touch. Against [Kastro](https://anilist.co/character/63099/Kastro), he utilized Texture Surprise to hide his wounds and confuse him. It can also be applied to pure aura, such as Hisoka\'s Bungee Gum, to alter his own appearance. Since no aura is detectable once Texture Surprise is active, whether through eyesight, touch, or extrasensorial perception, its effects are also visible to individuals unable to use Nen, it is safe to assume Texture Surprise is a Conjuration ability, which is further supported by its requiring Hisoka\'s direct action to be dispelled and by a verb used in its description.!~\n\n(Source: HunterHunter Wikia, HxH Japanese Wikipedia)','2020-10-19 11:26:56','2020-10-19 11:26:56','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b31-FZckOuu7L1un.png','SC'),(861,'Canary','Canary is a servant to Zaoldyeck.

Since birth, he trained endlessly in the art of assassination. He eventually ran away from his family and profession to participate in the Hunter exam. He befriended [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) almost immediately and has loyally followed him since then. Killua is usually a kind-hearted and playful boy, but once provoked he becomes extremely violent and bloodthirsty. This seems to be a trait he got from [his father](https://anilist.co/character/60/Silva-Zoldyck), who believes that Killua would eventually return home as an assassin. He is also a transmuter and constantly strives to improve his nen ability, developing many interesting techniques as the show progresses.\n\n##__Killua\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Lightning Palm__ (雷掌 Izutsushi)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first ability Killua named, as well as the most basic one in his arsenal, consists in him electrocuting his opponent by touching them with both palms and pushing them back. The first and only time this Nen ability was used, it barely seared [Sub](https://anilist.co/character/33304/Sub)\'s sweater, but hurt and stunned him for a few seconds.\n\n__Thunderbolt__ (落雷 Narukami)\nType: Transmutation\nKillua leaps into the air above the opponent and projects a bolt of lightning from his fingers, paralyzing them for a few moments and causing them pain. Although the ability was unable to inflict any visible damage to [Rammot](https://anilist.co/character/83211/Rammot) even before the latter learned Nen, it succeeded in stunning [Menthuthuyoupi](https://anilist.co/character/43953/Menthuthuyoupi). On both occasions, Thunderbolt was utilized to allow an ally to strike the opponent while they were vulnerable.\n\n__Godspeed__ (神速 Kanmuru)\n\n- Whirlwind (疾風迅雷 Shippū Jinrai)\nType: Transmutation\nThe first core function of Godspeed has Killua react automatically to external stimuli. Instead of the normal process of the stimulus being perceived by the nerves, which transmit a signal to the brain which in turn sends an instruction to the muscles, Killua programs his aura to send an electric signal to his muscles so as to instantly react to a threat, bypassing the comparatively slow nervous system. The aura can be preprogrammed to respond to different stimuli: physical contact, malevolent intent in enemy aura, or someone stepping in a predetermined perimeter, and the specific response is preprogrammed as well.\nConcretely, this results in a drastic boost to Killua\'s reaction time, which has both offensive and defensive uses. When Killua used a prototype of this ability, he was able to grab a dart between the instant it was conjured, already in contact with his skin, and the moment it punctured it. Whirlwind is also effective as an offensive ability. If the opponent executes the action Killua has preprogrammed a response for, he will, in most cases, be able to land an attack before they can, thanks to both his reaction and his movement speed being drastically enhanced. When he used this application of Godspeed against Menthuthuyoupi, Killua was able to momentarily disappear from his sight, and struck him several times without the latter being able to do anything, the short lapse between the Royal Guard\'s aura surging and him taking any action being enough for Killua to preempt any move his adversary could make. Youpi himself admitted to being completely powerless throughout the beating. On that occasion, despite his attacks inflicting no damage at all, Killua\'s electricity proved powerful enough to elicit screams of pain out of Youpi, as well as to paralyze him for a few instants. When he later used the same ability against [Shaiapouf](https://anilist.co/character/41135/Shaiapouf)\'s clone, which is considerably swift in its own right, Killua was able to dodge its attacks with [Komugi](https://anilist.co/character/14313/Komugi) on his back, leading Pouf to fear that even with all his cells, he would have a hard time catching him, and then burn off its cells by generating an electric current between his fingers whenever it stepped into a circle he had drawn.\nSince giving an order to one\'s aura is generally a Manipulation skill, it is possible, albeit unconfirmed, that Whirlwind makes use of this Nen category.\n\n- Speed of Lightning (電光石火 Denkō Sekka)\nType: Transmutation\nThe second application of Godspeed allows Killua to retain conscious control of his movements. His running speed and jumping ability increase dramatically, hence why he uses it primarily to cover long distances in a very short amount of time. As a consequence, this core function is more affected than Whirlwind by the terrain: Tsubone was able to keep Killua in sight while he was running through the woods, but was shaken off as soon as he reached a paved road. However, even at full throttle, he was severely outsped by Tsubone\'s motorcycle transformation while she had two riders. The butler estimated that by crossing the woods, it would take Killua 10 minutes to reach a destination about 40km (approx. 24.8 mi.) away, whereas a car driver would take twice as long. This suggests that on unfavorable terrain, Killua\'s speed with Speed of Lightning is approximately 240km/h (about 149.1 mph). If he carries someone, they will suffer mild electric shocks as long as they are in contact with him.!~\n\n(Source: Hunter x Hunter Wiki)','2020-10-19 11:26:57','2020-10-19 11:26:57','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b27-5dssrtgMb7Yd.jpg','SC'),(873,'Kortopi','As one of the members of the Phantom Troupe, the most distinctive thing about Kortopi is his haggard appearance.

In actuality, his membership is a farce, a fact he reveals at an opportune time.!~\n\n##__Hisoka\'s Abilities__\n\n~!__Bungee Gum__ (伸縮自在の愛 Elastic Love)\nType: Transmutation\nHisoka\'s main ability allows him to make his aura sticky and elastic. Its extreme durability, flexibility, and adhesive properties make it an exceptionally versatile ability with several offensive, defensive, and supplementary applications. He can activate it from his fingers, hands, and feet. He can attach it both through physical contact and remotely, by extending it towards the target, which makes it very difficult to avoid. He can give it the command to contract at will, and it snaps back with greater force the more it is stretched. It is so resilient that it did not tear after absorbing the full force of a ball hurled by [Gon](https://anilist.co/character/30/Gon-Freecss) with Rock, or several of [Gotoh](https://anilist.co/character/60009/Gotoh)\'s coins, which makes it an effective way of returning projectiles to the sender.\nOffensively, Bungee Gum can be used to pull the opponent towards Hisoka or to create flail-like weapons. He can also separate it from his body, in which case it will tear after a maximum stretch of 10 meters. He most commonly detaches it from his body to attach projectiles to his opponent, such as his Shu-enhanced cards, while concealing it with In. The combination of the latter technique and Bungee Gum allows Hisoka to lay multi-layered traps that spring all at once, killing the unsuspecting opponent in a flash. He has also emitted it to restrain individuals as powerful as [Machi](https://anilist.co/character/5830/Machi-Komacine).\n\nBungee Gum also has a wide range of auxiliary applications. Hisoka can attach it to a solid surface to retreat at extreme speed when the need arises. By using it on his feet, he can adhere to the ground or run on walls. It is also useful for sticking objects in place for traps or to keep hold of them, even after throwing them. By covering a wound with it, he can instantly stop hemorrhages. On one occasion, he enveloped his lungs and heart with it so it would resuscitate him. By creating non-adhesive aura, he can also replace missing limbs, which can coil like a spring to propel himself at tremendous velocity.\n\n__Texture Surprise__ (薄っぺらな嘘 Flimsy Lies)\nType: Conjuration\nHisoka can apply his aura to any smooth, flat surface, such as paper or cloth, and manifest imagery on it to change its appearance and texture for deception. He can replicate over one thousand different textures. He has tricked Nen users of the Spiders\' caliber with this ability, with none of them realizing he had used it, either by sight or by touch. Against [Kastro](https://anilist.co/character/63099/Kastro), he utilized Texture Surprise to hide his wounds and confuse him. It can also be applied to pure aura, such as Hisoka\'s Bungee Gum, to alter his own appearance. Since no aura is detectable once Texture Surprise is active, whether through eyesight, touch, or extrasensorial perception, its effects are also visible to individuals unable to use Nen, it is safe to assume Texture Surprise is a Conjuration ability, which is further supported by its requiring Hisoka\'s direct action to be dispelled and by a verb used in its description.!~\n\n(Source: HunterHunter Wikia, HxH Japanese Wikipedia)','2020-10-19 11:27:01','2020-10-19 11:27:01','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b31-FZckOuu7L1un.png','SC'),(884,'Feitan Portor','A mysterious member of the Phantom Troupe, Feitan is attired in what one would expect from a bandit - dark clothes with a skullhead scarf that covers his mouth.

The theft victim, of course, no longer has access to their stolen ability. \n\nThe theft happens under strict conditions:\n       1. He must witness the Nen ability in action with his eyes.\n       2. He must ask about the ability and be answered by the victim.\n       3. His victim\'s palm must touch the handprint on the cover of Bandit\'s Secret    \n       4. All of the above must be done within an hour.\n\nTo use one of the stolen abilities, he first conjures Bandit\'s Secret and turns to the page of the wanted ability. While using an ability, Chrollo must turn to the page with the ability on it and the book must remain open in his right hand; this means he could only have access to one chosen ability at a time. The abilities are subjected not only to the Limitations but also to the emotions and thinking of their creators: for example, despite seeing corpses as immobile masses no different from objects, Chrollo cannot use Order Stamp on cadavers due to the outlook of the original owner, despite it not being a Limitation. Additionally, an ability vanishes from the book if its former owner dies. However, if their Nen has become stronger after death, Chrollo can keep their ability even if the original owner passes away. Expert Nen users can see through some of these conditions, as [Zeno Zoldyck](https://anilist.co/character/59/Zeno-Zoldyck) rightly guessed that Chrollo must endure 4 to 5 hardships before he can steal an ability.\n\n__Double Face__ (栞のテーマ Bookmark Theme)\nType: Specialization\nThis bookmark allows Chrollo to maintain access to any ability on the page it is placed, even if the book is closed and he is not touching it, circumventing one of the conditions placed on Skill Hunter. With both hands now free, Chrollo can now use hand-to-hand combat in conjunction with his stolen abilities. Furthermore, if Chrollo keeps the book open to a particular page and uses the bookmark on another, he becomes capable of utilizing two stolen abilities at the same time. The bookmark was specified to belong to the book itself and not to be a stolen ability.!~\n\n(Source: Hunter x Hunter Wiki)\n','2020-10-19 11:27:02','2020-10-19 11:27:02','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n58-Mw9dh2mRe4ux.jpg','MC'),(888,'Shaiapouf','Butterfly-humanoid Chimera Ant and one of [Meruem](https://anilist.co/character/23277)\'s Royal Guards.','2020-10-19 11:27:02','2020-10-19 11:27:02','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n41135-tTO36i1YAA5L.jpg','SC'),(889,'Ging Freecss','__Gender:__ Male\n__Age:__ 31-32\n__Height:__ 176 cm\n__Weight:__ 63 kg\n\nA famous 2-star ancient ruins hunter and the father of Gon Freeccs.

The matter was eventually resolved with the help of Shinobu at the cost of some of Hanekawa\'s memories, but the problem emerged again right before the school festival because of different stress. Araragi was told by Hanekawa\'s bakeneko form that she has feelings for him.  In \'Tsubasa Tiger\' (Nekomonogatari: Shiro), on her way to school, she met a tiger spirit which spoke to her.

He is renowned and even revered by many players in the realm of high-school basketball, and is one of the few players to have held his own against the Generation of Miracles during their peak. While he is currently able to play, the knee injury he sustained during his freshman year was quite severe: formally speaking it required surgery, but the process would make him unable to play basketball for the rest of his high school career.

Its major flaw is a location issue; his diary is rendered useless at predicting anywhere outside his patrolling district.   ~!Calm, cool and collected, Keiga at first does not appear to care about winning the game.

Like the Fourth, her \"Escape\" diary goes along with the type of profession she is involved in. Whenever Minene faces a dire situation, the diary will chart out the best course of actions she can take in order to get out of a tight spot. Based on the function of her diary, it might even help reduce the chances of her receiving a Dead End and it is probably one of the best diaries to have in Deus\' game of survival. The diary\'s only shortcoming is that there are some circumstances where the odds are too heavily stacked against Minene to the point where the diary won\'t be able to secure an escape route for her.   An infamous atheistic terrorist, Minene is a young woman who bears a strong hatred for organized religion, particularly God.    ~!Her hatred of religion stems from her past when she and parents were traveling in a city in the Middle East but got caught in a battle, which is hinted between Israelis and Palestinians, where her parents were killed in the crossfire. Blaming God for her parents death, she leads a crusade of destruction against those associated with God.   Minene got involved in the Diary game when after a failed assassination to kill a Catholic Cardinal, she tried to escape but almost fell to her death but was saved by Deus who gave her an offer to save her if she join his game. Minene\'s diary is the Escape Diary, which will chart out the best course of actions for her to escape whenever she finds herself in a dangerous situation. While it means she can escape anything, it is not perfect as the diary can only tell her how to escape if there are favorably conditions that allow her any chance to escape.   Originally, she wants to win the game to destroy religion worldwide but later mellows out after befriending Yuki and his friends. While she began as an antagonist against Yuki, she later became his ally, becoming a big sister figure to him and both of them hold no animosity with each other despite Minene was responsible for the destruction and deaths at his school and Yuki was the one who blinded her left eye. She shares an interesting relationship with Masumi Nishijima of the police whom she met during her failed assassination of the Cardinal. While she constantly dismisses all of his attempts to get to know her, she finally relents and eventually falls in love with Masumi.   In the anime, during the last episode it was shown that Minene, from the second world, and Masumi, from the third world live together and have two children. Third world Minene is still a terrorist. !~ She is named after Minerva — the Roman goddess of wisdom, commerce, weaving, crafts and magic.

Yukiteru\'s condition and actions are recorded every ten minutes in her \"Yukiteru\" diary, it also provides small commentary made by Yuno in some of the entries. Its most obvious weakness is that it does not show Yuno\'s future at all -- her condition, situation, or surroundings — unless it somehow involves Yuki. Working with Yukiteru\'s \"Random Diary\" diary, however, covers both of their diaries\' individual flaws; as it has been said the two make for a perfect combo.  Smart, beautiful and diligent — those who don\'t truly know Gasai Yuno would simply see the model student role she plays while at school. She is secretly obsessed with Yukiteru and would do anything within her power to assist him. She can be quite clingy and is highly fond of stalking him. When obstacles arise that either endangers Yukki\'s life or threatens their relationship, her thoughts turn murderous and she lets nothing get in the way of her path. Yuno is also able to quickly analyze and adapt to unexpected situations that may arise, and she puts thoughts into action without hesitation, performing what needs to be done without ever losing her nerves. These traits make her one of the strongest players in Deus\'s game, despite having one of the weakest diaries for providing self survival aid. And while Yukiteru is credited for triggering the greatest shift in future occurrences, Yuno is the one who has created the largest influence in those events. Yuno tends to carry around a box cutter with her at all times, though she will make use of other weaponry such as kitchen knives, hatchets, etc, when required.  She is named after the Roman goddess Juno.   ~!Yuno\'s behavior was the result of her parents, who used to be loving parents before becoming demanding and pressuring their daughter to be the perfect citizen to the point they would lock her up in a cage and only allowed her certain amount of time for her to sleep and how much food she ate. Their treatment drove Yuno insane up to the point that she locked her parents in the same cage, hoping they would realize how she felt and change back to their old-selves only for them to die of hunger. To hide her parents\' death, she made a cover story that they were working over-seas but Yuki would later learn about this as well as the truth after Akise investigated the bodies.!~   __MAJOR SPOILER__:  ~!Yuno is actually the \"first Yuno\", after she became God in the game she realized she could not bring Yuki back to life.

After fighting against Mob and losing, he quit his shadow leader role. He is currently a second-year student at Black Vinegar Middle School.\n\nBefore meeting and fighting against Mob, Teruki was an arrogant and overconfident esper.

Mikan may not show it, but she cares very deeply for Rito and misses his company, and states how they used to play together before Lala entered their lives.  Mikan grows quite attached to Golden Darkness, perhaps due to Darkness seemingly being the same age as her.

Haruna has similar feelings for him, having been attracted to his kind, gentle nature since junior high. Despite her growing love for Rito, which she believes to be unrequited, she usually suppresses her feelings and cannot confess to him because of her friendship with Lala who also loves Rito. However, with some encouragement, she tells Lala of her ordeal, to which Lala accepts, claiming Haruna as her rival for Rito\'s heart, while remaining friends. She lives with her older sister Akiho Sairenji in an apartment and has a severe fear of ghosts and the supernatural, the exception being Oshizu Murasame but only to an extent.\n\nWhen frightened, she has a habit of grabbing the nearest thing around her – typically Rito – and swinging him wildly, in an attempt to get rid of whatever frightens her. There is also a running gag to where Rito is about to confess to her, only for something (or someone) to come between it. She lives with her older sister in an apartment.\n\nA highly responsible person, Haruna\'s personality can sway her classmates\' hearts to vote for her as their class representative, even when she did not run to be a candidate.

Golden Darkness is currently staying on Earth, roaming around the city streets and Sainan High, with a motivation to continue her duty to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this (hinting she only said this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed). Commonly referred as \"Yami-chan\", she spends her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it is the only thing she eats on Earth since it is the first food offered by Rito, prior to spending a night at the Yuuki residence for a sukiyaki dinner).

She carries a unique ability to turn her body parts into various objects through use of nano machines circulating her body, ranging from swords to dragon heads. Unfortunately, excessive use becomes a hazard to her health.

Doing so cost him his life, and before dying he asked that the villagers not see Naruto as the monster within him, instead wanting him to be viewed as a hero, a request ignored by the villagers. \"Namikaze\" translates literally as \"Wave wind\". \"Minato\" translates as \"Harbor\" or \"Port\".    ~!Minato shares a number of traits with Naruto, namely in appearance and attitude. Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well.

Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha\'s Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one\'s palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete.

Because of this, he was locked away in a cage for most of his life, only released occasionally when needed to fight other clans.  Like many of Orochimaru\'s closest followers, Kimimaro was branded with a cursed seal, which gives him greater power at the expense of his free will. When in his level 2 form, his appearance is similar to that of a dinosaur, with dark gray skin, six large bone spines on the back of his chest, and a long bone spiked tail. He also possesses a great deal of control over his cursed seal, as he is able to control its spread throughout his body without fully activating it. Kimimaro was apparently friends with Jugo at one point, and his control over his cursed seal impressed the latter. Karin claims that Kimimaro was the only one who could stop Jugo without getting hurt.   ~!

During one of Kirigakure\'s annual events of pitting graduating ninja against each other, Zabuza singlehandedly killed all of his peers, bringing an end to the ritual and causing him to be called the \"Demon of the Hidden Mist\". Zabuza would go on to become one of the Seven Shinobi Swordsmen of the Mist where he acquired his zanbatō, and also became a member of the Kirigakure ANBU. At some point in time, Zabuza found a young boy named Haku wandering the countryside, and offered to take Haku in as his tool. Haku accepted and became loyal to Zabuza, learning from Zabuza and protecting him whenever necessary. Zabuza eventually attempted a coup d\'état on the Land of Water by trying to assassinate the Mizukage. The coup failed, forcing Zabuza and his subordinates to leave the country. In the hopes of gaining funds for a second coup, Zabuza became a hired assassin, killing anyone if the price was right.  Being from Kirigakure, Zabuza excels in water-oriented jutsu, some of which are exclusive to him. With Water Release: Water Dragon Blast Technique (Suiton: Suiryūdan no Jutsu, Viz \"Water Release: Water Dragon Missile\") he can form a dragon from the surrounding water to attack others as needed. His Water Release: Great Waterfall Technique (Suiton: Daibakufu no Jutsu, English TV \"Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu\") allows him to fire a massive spiraling blast of water at an opponent. In addition to the offensive capabilities of his water jutsu, Zabuza is very skilled in assassinations. By blanketing the area in mist with Hiding Mist Technique (Kirigakure no Jutsu, Viz \"Art of Hiding in the Mist\"), Zabuza can blind an opponent and use his training as an ANBU to find them based on the sounds they make. Once found, Zabuza uses Silent Homicide Technique (Muon Satsujin Jutsu, English TV \"Silent Killing Jutsu\") to kill the opponent without their noticing his presence. This talent with assassinations is very well-known, as even the ninja of Konohagakure are familiar with Zabuza\'s history.   ~!Zabuza is hired by Gato to kill the bridge builder Tazuna. After his initial attempt fails to kill Tazuna and his escorts (Kakashi Hatake and his students) and leads to his defeat, Zabuza and Haku seek a rematch after he recovers. Once tracking down Team 7 again, Zabuza is drawn into battle with Kakashi while Haku deals with his students. Although he tries to avoid Kakashi, he is eventually restrained and Kakashi prepares to kill him with his Lightning Blade. Before he can land a blow, however, Haku appears to use himself as a human shield for Zabuza, fulfilling his promise of being a tool for his master. Zabuza is freed as a result of Haku\'s intervention and tries to attack Kakashi, though Kakashi is able to avoid the attack and make both of Zabuza\'s arms useless. With Zabuza no longer able to fight, Gato arrives with his henchmen to finish the job instead, ending the battle between Zabuza and Kakashi. Naruto Uzumaki, however, is angered that Zabuza has yet to show remorse for Haku\'s death and explains Haku\'s devotion to him. Brought to tears by his words, Zabuza reveals that he did care for Haku and decides to repent for what he has done. After taking a kunai in his mouth, Zabuza charges through Gato\'s men, being stabbed multiple times along the way though eventually reaching and killing Gato. After collapsing due to his injuries Zabuza asks to be brought to Haku\'s side, wanting to be by his side in death as Haku was by his in life. Kakashi complies, and in his dying moments Zabuza wishes to go to the same afterlife as Haku.  Shinobi World War Arc   In preparation for the Fourth Shinobi World War, Zabuza is resurrected by Kabuto Yakushi to fight against the Allied Shinobi Forces, before being mobilised alongside Haku, Gari, Pakura and Toroi. Overhearing Zabuza as he told Haku that they were no longer in the afterlife, Gari informs them of their current situation, infuriating Zabuza because he didn\'t want to obey someone who would stoop so low as to use the dead. Ambushed by the Surprise Attack Division, Haku protects them both from the explosive tags carried by Sai\'s ink birds, but Zabuza calls it unnecessary once he observes the others regenerating. This irritates Zabuza further, who remarks that not only were they brought back, they were also made impossible to kill. Stating that he was the only one amongst his group to not possess a Kekkai Genkai, Zabuza storms the recently grounded opposition but is intercepted by Kakashi, whom he didn\'t expect to fight again. Greeting Sakura and noting her growth since they last met, Zabuza enquires about Naruto, learning from Kakashi how famous he had become since his death.  As Kabuto erases their consciousness, Zabuza pleads with Kakashi to stop him no matter what it took, as his humanity was already dead. Enveloping the battlefield in a thick mist, Zabuza then assualts the Third Division, until he is confronted by Kakashi. Amidst the battle, the previous generation of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist are summoned to the field in order for Akatsuki to retain the upper hand, with Zabuza soon joining them whilst wielding his broken Kubikiribōchō.

His main goals are to capture Uchiha Sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the Sharingan and to destroy Konoha.   ~~~ __Background__~~~  From his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru\'s goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.  He was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru\'s natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru\'s personality.  Orochimaru\'s desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents\' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.  After leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi\'s body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan.   ~! After a failed attempt to take over Uchiha Sasuke\'s body, he was absorbed by Sasuke who didn\'t want to give himself up to a weakened Orochimaru. During Sasuke\'s later fight with Itachi, as Sasuke was too weak to suppress his chakra, he managed to escape and tried to take over his body once again, however was trapped in an inescapable dream-like realm by the legendary sword of Totsuka used by Uchiha Itachi.  He was resurrected by Uchiha Sasuke during the Fourth Shinobi War, who used Anko\'s cursed seal and a piece of Kabuto\'s flesh to bring him back. After his resurrection, he reabsorbed the chackra Kabuto stole from him and revealed that he doesn\'t have enough power to take over Sasuke\'s body and has no interest in the war.!~','2020-10-19 11:29:45','2020-10-19 11:29:45','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n2455-V9tLMS3TIgJW.png','MC'),(1412,'Naruto Uzumaki','__Ninja Registration Nº__: 012607  \n__Birthday__: October 10\n__Age__: 12-13 (I), 15-17 (II)  \n__Horoscope__: Libra  \n__Height__: 145.3cm - 147.5cm (I), 166cm (II)  \n__Weight__: 40.1 kg - 40.6 kg (I), 50.9kg (II)  \n__Blood Type__: B  \n__Family:__ ~!Minato Namikaze (father), Kushina Uzumaki (mother)!~ Jiraiya (godfather)  \n__Affiliation:__ Konohagakure, Mt.

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto\'s newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage\'s dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents\' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.','2020-10-19 11:29:45','2020-10-19 11:29:45','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b17-IazKGogQwJ1p.png','MC'),(1413,'Gaara',' __Ninja Registration Nº:__ 56-001  \n__Birth Date:__ 19 January   \n__Age:__ 12-13 (I), 15-16 (II)  \n__Horoscope:__ Capricorn  \n__Gender:__ Male  \n__Blood type:__ AB   \n__Height:__ 146 cm (Part I), 166 cm (Part II)  \n__Weight:__ 39 kg (Part I), 50.9 kg (Part II)  \n__Affiliation:__ Hidden Sand Village, Wind country  \n__Occupation:__ Kazekage, Regimental Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, Commander of the Fourth Division  \n__Team:__ Team Baki (Temari, Kankuro and Gaara )   __Tailed Beast:__ One-Tailed Shukaku   \n__Known relatives:__ Fourth Kazekage (father), Karura (mother), Temari (older sister), Kankuro (older brother), Yashamaru (uncle)\n\nGaara was introduced in the series in Chuunin Exams arc, as a violent shinobi from Konoha\'s allied country, the Wind country. He came to Konoha with his siblings Temari and Kankuro, and with his mentor Baki, to participate in Chuunin exams.  From the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. Due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, Gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself.   In fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of Japanese Kanji letter \"Ai\", which stands for \"Love\". In Gaara\'s case, that Love was for himself, as he was \"Demon loving only himself\".  Gaara\'s point of view dramatically changed after a clash with Naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. Since then, Gaara always feels in debt to Naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.  Like Naruto, Gaara is a Jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, Ichibi no Shukaku.

With his parents and family now gone his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.   After his fight with Naruto he believes he\'s been wasting his time \'playing ninja\' with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can revenge his clan by killing Itachi and then to restore the Uchiha clan.  As a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.   Claiming at first that he doesn\'t need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. He openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.   Sasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.  \n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke\'s clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.  \n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that\'s open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back.

Run, run and cling to life._   \n\n~~~ __ _Background___~~~  Itachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha\'s older brother.   Itachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine\'s popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.  Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi\'s prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.  He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family\'s future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi\'s younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.   ~!When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d\'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third\'s attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third\'s wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.  Before the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke\'s life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.  Knowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha\'s secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke\'s safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha.   Itachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke\'s hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru\'s replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.!~   \n\n~~~ __ _Personality___~~~  Ever since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.  As a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn\'t lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.  In addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.  Itachi\'s only initial interest was in Akatsuki\'s goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization\'s success and secrecy before everything else.As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.  However, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he had only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke\'s eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha\'s eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke\'s hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality.   Despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.  He, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi\'s hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi\'s most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.  When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke\'s Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).    \n\n~~~ __ _Abilities___~~~  Since a young age, Itachi\'s intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.   \n\n~~~ __ _Sharingan___~~~  Being of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent\'s movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent\'s genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels.    \n\n~~~ __ _Mangekyo Sharingan___~~~  Itachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent\'s mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata\'s Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi\'s mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.   ~!Despite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own Fūinjutsu in his last moments.!~\n \n(Sources: Naruto.com and Naruto.wikia.com )','2020-10-19 11:29:47','2020-10-19 11:29:47','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n14-jr5pH4YLWDke.jpg','MC'),(1424,'Kakashi Hatake','__Age:__ 25-26 (Part I); 28-29 (Part II)\n__Birthday:__ September 15\n__Horoscope:__ Virgo\n__Blood Type:__ O\n __Height:__ 5\'11\" (1.56 m)\n__Weight:__ 67.5 kg\n__Hair:__ Silver\n__Eyes:__ Black, Sharingan\n__Rank:__ Jonin; Former ANBU; Hokage Candidate\n__Likes:__ Icha-Icha series, Broiled Saury with salt, Miso soup with eggplant\n__Dislikes:__ Anything sweet  \n__Quote:__ (from Obito) \"A shinobi who violates the rules is scum, but a shinobi who abandons their friends is worse than scum\".\n\nMajor Background Spoilers.  ~!Like his father, Sakumo Hatake whose skills have been compared to that of the Legendary Ninja, Kakashi is considered a genius shinobi, graduating from the Ninja Academy at age 5 and achieving the rank of Chunin at 6. A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi\'s father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father\'s suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi – in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one\'s teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.  During an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja\'s attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi\'s damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.  Years later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several kōhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his kōhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.  Obito\'s death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito\'s traits. One such trait was Obito\'s concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito\'s chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha\'s memorial site, where Obito\'s name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi\'s personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he\'s confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.!~  Kakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi\'s subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy\'s part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.  Though he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").  Kakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another\'s arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.  With his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi\'s arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto\'s chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.  While Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent\'s rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.  When he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user\'s chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu\'s initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi\'s Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.','2020-10-19 11:29:47','2020-10-19 11:29:47','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b85-thWHf96gqMLi.png','MC'),(1425,'Utakata','Utakata (ウタカタ) was a shinobi from Kirigakure and the jinchūriki of the Six-Tailed Slug.

When Sasori was young, his parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, leaving him with no one but his grandmother, Chiyo, to take care of him. To cheer up Sasori, Chiyo began to teach him the art of making puppets. He began making puppets at the age of five, and even made puppets that resembled his parents to get rid of the terrible loneliness he felt. But because they were only puppets, incapable of giving him the natural parental love he desired, he lost interest in them. They later fell into Chiyo\'s possession. Sasori proved to be a born natural at the art, even devising masterful ways of eliminating a puppet master\'s weakness.  Sasori created many ingenious puppets, including the ones that were owned by Kankurō.\n\nDuring the Third Great Shinobi World War, these puppets were used so successfully, they dyed the sand red with blood. This gave rise to to the name Sasori of the Red Sand. Twenty years before his introduction in the series, he left Sunagakure, though not before secretly kidnapping and killing the Third Kazekage. More than that, Sasori eventually made more then one puppet body in his image maintain his youthful appearance and increase his own offensive capabilities, but retained his heart — the only still-living part of his body — in a cylindrical container in the left part of his chest, he claims was his only weakness.\n\nSometime after leaving the village, Sasori joined Akatsuki, and was eventually paired with Orochimaru. They had great respect for each other during their partnership, and did many things together. After Orochimaru left Akatsuki, Sasori was teamed up with Deidara, although he always carried a grudge against his former partner. He sent Kabuto Yakushi to spy on Orochimaru, but Orochimaru dispelled Sasori\'s jutsu and convinced Kabuto to join him. Sasori was also shown having numerous other underlings and spies in many nations, such as Yūra and Mukade.!~','2020-10-19 11:29:49','2020-10-19 11:29:49','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b1900-Dpd9wVWtlvIx.png','MC'),(1427,'Shizuka','A kunoichi and future leader of the Nadeshiko Village.

During one of Kirigakure\'s annual events of pitting graduating ninja against each other, Zabuza singlehandedly killed all of his peers, bringing an end to the ritual and causing him to be called the \"Demon of the Hidden Mist\". Zabuza would go on to become one of the Seven Shinobi Swordsmen of the Mist where he acquired his zanbatō, and also became a member of the Kirigakure ANBU. At some point in time, Zabuza found a young boy named Haku wandering the countryside, and offered to take Haku in as his tool. Haku accepted and became loyal to Zabuza, learning from Zabuza and protecting him whenever necessary. Zabuza eventually attempted a coup d\'état on the Land of Water by trying to assassinate the Mizukage. The coup failed, forcing Zabuza and his subordinates to leave the country. In the hopes of gaining funds for a second coup, Zabuza became a hired assassin, killing anyone if the price was right.  Being from Kirigakure, Zabuza excels in water-oriented jutsu, some of which are exclusive to him. With Water Release: Water Dragon Blast Technique (Suiton: Suiryūdan no Jutsu, Viz \"Water Release: Water Dragon Missile\") he can form a dragon from the surrounding water to attack others as needed. His Water Release: Great Waterfall Technique (Suiton: Daibakufu no Jutsu, English TV \"Water Style: Giant Vortex Jutsu\") allows him to fire a massive spiraling blast of water at an opponent. In addition to the offensive capabilities of his water jutsu, Zabuza is very skilled in assassinations. By blanketing the area in mist with Hiding Mist Technique (Kirigakure no Jutsu, Viz \"Art of Hiding in the Mist\"), Zabuza can blind an opponent and use his training as an ANBU to find them based on the sounds they make. Once found, Zabuza uses Silent Homicide Technique (Muon Satsujin Jutsu, English TV \"Silent Killing Jutsu\") to kill the opponent without their noticing his presence. This talent with assassinations is very well-known, as even the ninja of Konohagakure are familiar with Zabuza\'s history.   ~!Zabuza is hired by Gato to kill the bridge builder Tazuna. After his initial attempt fails to kill Tazuna and his escorts (Kakashi Hatake and his students) and leads to his defeat, Zabuza and Haku seek a rematch after he recovers. Once tracking down Team 7 again, Zabuza is drawn into battle with Kakashi while Haku deals with his students. Although he tries to avoid Kakashi, he is eventually restrained and Kakashi prepares to kill him with his Lightning Blade. Before he can land a blow, however, Haku appears to use himself as a human shield for Zabuza, fulfilling his promise of being a tool for his master. Zabuza is freed as a result of Haku\'s intervention and tries to attack Kakashi, though Kakashi is able to avoid the attack and make both of Zabuza\'s arms useless. With Zabuza no longer able to fight, Gato arrives with his henchmen to finish the job instead, ending the battle between Zabuza and Kakashi. Naruto Uzumaki, however, is angered that Zabuza has yet to show remorse for Haku\'s death and explains Haku\'s devotion to him. Brought to tears by his words, Zabuza reveals that he did care for Haku and decides to repent for what he has done. After taking a kunai in his mouth, Zabuza charges through Gato\'s men, being stabbed multiple times along the way though eventually reaching and killing Gato. After collapsing due to his injuries Zabuza asks to be brought to Haku\'s side, wanting to be by his side in death as Haku was by his in life. Kakashi complies, and in his dying moments Zabuza wishes to go to the same afterlife as Haku.

Overhearing Zabuza as he told Haku that they were no longer in the afterlife, Gari informs them of their current situation, infuriating Zabuza because he didn\'t want to obey someone who would stoop so low as to use the dead. Ambushed by the Surprise Attack Division, Haku protects them both from the explosive tags carried by Sai\'s ink birds, but Zabuza calls it unnecessary once he observes the others regenerating. This irritates Zabuza further, who remarks that not only were they brought back, they were also made impossible to kill. Stating that he was the only one amongst his group to not possess a Kekkai Genkai, Zabuza storms the recently grounded opposition but is intercepted by Kakashi, whom he didn\'t expect to fight again. Greeting Sakura and noting her growth since they last met, Zabuza enquires about Naruto, learning from Kakashi how famous he had become since his death.  As Kabuto erases their consciousness, Zabuza pleads with Kakashi to stop him no matter what it took, as his humanity was already dead. Enveloping the battlefield in a thick mist, Zabuza then assualts the Third Division, until he is confronted by Kakashi. Amidst the battle, the previous generation of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist are summoned to the field in order for Akatsuki to retain the upper hand, with Zabuza soon joining them whilst wielding his broken Kubikiribōchō. In the end of the fight Zabuza is captured by Ensui Nara and sealed by Maki.!~','2020-10-19 11:29:49','2020-10-19 11:29:49','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b728-MOfppNC4EEo0.jpg','SC'),(1430,'Akamaru','Akamaru is the nin-dog of Inuzuka Kiba.

His main goals are to capture Uchiha Sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the Sharingan and to destroy Konoha.   ~~~ __Background__~~~  From his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru\'s goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.  He was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru\'s natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru\'s personality.  Orochimaru\'s desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents\' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.  After leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi\'s body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan.   ~! After a failed attempt to take over Uchiha Sasuke\'s body, he was absorbed by Sasuke who didn\'t want to give himself up to a weakened Orochimaru. During Sasuke\'s later fight with Itachi, as Sasuke was too weak to suppress his chakra, he managed to escape and tried to take over his body once again, however was trapped in an inescapable dream-like realm by the legendary sword of Totsuka used by Uchiha Itachi.  He was resurrected by Uchiha Sasuke during the Fourth Shinobi War, who used Anko\'s cursed seal and a piece of Kabuto\'s flesh to bring him back. After his resurrection, he reabsorbed the chackra Kabuto stole from him and revealed that he doesn\'t have enough power to take over Sasuke\'s body and has no interest in the war.!~','2020-10-19 11:29:50','2020-10-19 11:29:50','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n2455-V9tLMS3TIgJW.png','SC'),(1435,'Gaara',' __Ninja Registration Nº:__ 56-001  \n__Birth Date:__ 19 January   \n__Age:__ 12-13 (I), 15-16 (II)  \n__Horoscope:__ Capricorn  \n__Gender:__ Male  \n__Blood type:__ AB   \n__Height:__ 146 cm (Part I), 166 cm (Part II)  \n__Weight:__ 39 kg (Part I), 50.9 kg (Part II)  \n__Affiliation:__ Hidden Sand Village, Wind country  \n__Occupation:__ Kazekage, Regimental Commander of the Allied Shinobi Forces, Commander of the Fourth Division  \n__Team:__ Team Baki (Temari, Kankuro and Gaara )   __Tailed Beast:__ One-Tailed Shukaku   \n__Known relatives:__ Fourth Kazekage (father), Karura (mother), Temari (older sister), Kankuro (older brother), Yashamaru (uncle)\n\nGaara was introduced in the series in Chuunin Exams arc, as a violent shinobi from Konoha\'s allied country, the Wind country. He came to Konoha with his siblings Temari and Kankuro, and with his mentor Baki, to participate in Chuunin exams.  From the first look, he was shown as merciless and violent individual. Due to his hard childhood, and lack of love, Gaara grew up hating everybody around him, loving only himself.   In fateful incident about 6 years before the main story time, he made himself a tattoo of Japanese Kanji letter \"Ai\", which stands for \"Love\". In Gaara\'s case, that Love was for himself, as he was \"Demon loving only himself\".  Gaara\'s point of view dramatically changed after a clash with Naruto, who taught him the true meaning of loving others. Since then, Gaara always feels in debt to Naruto, and tries to help him as much as he can.  Like Naruto, Gaara is a Jinchuuriki who holds within him the one tailed beast, Ichibi no Shukaku. Gaara also relates to Naruto in that in his early years, Gaara was often repelled by other children, and feared by Suna\'s citizens due to the incredible power he possessed.','2020-10-19 11:29:50','2020-10-19 11:29:50','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b1662-90BUBhf8PHGz.png','MC'),(1436,'Naruto Uzumaki','__Ninja Registration Nº__: 012607  \n__Birthday__: October 10\n__Age__: 12-13 (I), 15-17 (II)  \n__Horoscope__: Libra  \n__Height__: 145.3cm - 147.5cm (I), 166cm (II)  \n__Weight__: 40.1 kg - 40.6 kg (I), 50.9kg (II)  \n__Blood Type__: B  \n__Family:__ ~!Minato Namikaze (father), Kushina Uzumaki (mother)!~ Jiraiya (godfather)  \n__Affiliation:__ Konohagakure, Mt.

When born, a powerful nine-tailed demon fox attacked his village. With a wave of its tail, the demon fox could raise tsunamis and shatter mountains. In a valiant attempt to save the village from destruction, the Fourth Hokage and leader of the Hidden Leaf Village sealed the demon fox within Naruto\'s newborn body. This was his final act, for the battle with the fox cost him his life.  Despite the Fourth Hokage\'s dying wish that Naruto is viewed as a hero for serving as the container for the demon (a  _Jinchuuriki_), the adult villagers of Konoha harbored a fierce hatred for him, with many believing that Naruto and the demons were one and the same. Cast aside as an inhuman monster, Naruto was outcast and ostracised by the villagers for reasons he could not understand. The children his age could only ever follow their parents\' example; and they too came to harbor a fierce hatred for Naruto.  Naruto eventually came to accept that he would live and die alone, and his external response was to perform harmless pranks on the village. Coy, raffish, and full of life, Naruto soon came to display a somewhat unexpected determination to succeed and be accepted by others. Upon being assigned to \"Team Seven\" as a Genin-ranked ninja, his true potential soon became outwardly apparent.  Vowing to become Hokage one day and using his will to never give in, Naruto saves the village from invading forces and earns his acceptance. Eventually, Naruto learns to harness the power of the Demon Fox sealed inside him to perform acts of strength far beyond what any other human is capable of.  In all, Naruto is an admirable character whose sheer determination to succeed despite the odds, earns him respect and devotion from his fellow villagers.','2020-10-19 11:29:50','2020-10-19 11:29:50','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b17-IazKGogQwJ1p.png','SC'),(1437,'Shibi Aburame','Shibi is Shino\'s father.

Such comparisons are common throughout the first part of the series, and in the second as well. The second part of the series reveals that Naruto is his son, hence the comparisons, born to Kushina Uzumaki. In his youth Minato, along with two other unknown Genin, was a student of Jiraiya. Prior to becoming Hokage, he was also the sensei of Kakashi Hatake, Obito Uchiha, and Rin. !~ Minato is said to be the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced, with natural talent that had not been seen in many years. He created several distinctive techniques, including the Hiraishin no Jutsu, which essentially allowed him to teleport to any location with the use of a special seal. By attaching the seal to a kunai or an enemy, Minato could teleport to the location of the seal unnoticed, allowing him to wipe out nearby opponents almost instantly. This ability led to his title as \"Konoha\'s Yellow Flash\", and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one\'s palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact. Later in the series it is revealed that technique is actually incomplete. Minato had planned to add his own nature manipulation training to the Rasengan, making it even more powerful, but could not manage to prior to his death.   ~!Later during the war he is resurrected by Orochimaru with Edo Tensei alongside all the deceased Hokage on Sasuke\'s demand.!~','2020-10-19 11:29:51','2020-10-19 11:29:51','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b2535-Xq9WKNPJQEt3.png','SC'),(1440,'Fudou','Fudō was part of the group of grave robbers who dug up four of the dead Twelve Guardian Ninja.

A few years after these accomplishments, Kakashi\'s father was disgraced by the village for abandoning a mission in favor of saving his comrades, which cost the Land of Fire dearly. Deeply ashamed and ostracized even by those he had saved, Sakumo committed seppuku, leaving Kakashi to bear witness to the event. After his father\'s suicide, Kakashi began to adhere strictly to the rules of the shinobi – in particular the rule dictating that the success of the mission must come before the well being of one\'s teammates, causing him to become arrogant, humorless, and by-the-book.  During an attempt to save Rin, Kakashi lost his left eye as a result of taking an enemy ninja\'s attack for Obito. To protect Kakashi in return, Obito managed to awaken his Sharingan and killed their assailant. Soon after saving Rin, a rockfall technique was triggered and a rock struck Kakashi on his blind side. He would have been buried beneath the rocks had Obito not pushed Kakashi out of the way, getting the right side of his body almost completely crushed in the process. Shortly before he died, Obito had Rin (a medical ninja) implant his Sharingan eye in Kakashi\'s damaged eye socket as a gift. As his first act with his new eye, Kakashi avenged Obito by killing the enemy ninja with his now-perfected Chidori technique, bringing the Kakashi of today into being.  Years later Kakashi would become a member of the Konohagakure ANBU where he served as a squad leader. During this time, he had several kōhai, named Yugao Uzuki and Tenzo, and recognized the latter as the most successful of his kōhai. It is unknown when or why he left ANBU, but he still wears iron guards on his gloves, a characteristic of ANBU uniforms.  Obito\'s death profoundly changed Kakashi, and Kakashi adopted many of Obito\'s traits. One such trait was Obito\'s concept of teamwork, which is most clearly seen in the way Kakashi tests newly-graduated students hoping to become a squad under him. He uses the bell test to test his students, which requires the three students to get the two bells he keeps on his person. Only those who get a bell get to pass, which would be difficult even with teamwork, as at least one ninja would fail regardless. However, the rule is only a ruse; the point of the test is to foster teamwork and to teach the students that teamwork is more important than the rules. Team 7 is the only team to realize this, and as such becomes the only team Kakashi passes into Genin-status. Kakashi also inherits Obito\'s chronic tardiness, due primarily to losing track of time during his frequent visits to Konoha\'s memorial site, where Obito\'s name is engraved. Ironically, this very habit is one that Kakashi was often annoyed at Obito about. Obito was supposedly late due to random good deeds. Kakashi\'s personal life appears to be as much of a mystery as the face behind the mask he has worn for most of his ninja career. He has no living family, or at least none he cares to acknowledge, and he\'s confirmed that everyone he loves is already dead.!~  Kakashi has an ongoing, albeit slightly one-sided, rivalry with Might Guy, with Guy constantly proclaiming that Kakashi is his rival, and considering his and Kakashi\'s subordinates rivals. Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy\'s part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.  Though he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (イチャイチャパラダイス, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (イチャイチャバイオレンス, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (イチャイチャタクティクス, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").  Kakashi\'s Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent\'s movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi\'s use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another\'s arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.  With his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi\'s arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (土遁・心中斬首の術, Doton: Shinjū Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto\'s chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.  While Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (魔幻・奈烙見の術, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (千年殺し, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent\'s rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.  When he was younger Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user\'s chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu\'s initial creation Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi\'s Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it.','2020-10-19 11:29:52','2020-10-19 11:29:52','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b85-thWHf96gqMLi.png','MC'),(1443,'Itachi Uchiha','__Name:__ Uchiha Itachi  \n__Age:__ 17-18 (I); 21 (II)  \n__Birthday:__ June 9th  \n__Zodiac:__ Gemini  \n__Height:__ 175 cm (I); 178 cm (II)  \n__Weight:__ 57 kg (I); 58 kg (II)  \n__Blood Type:__ AB  \n__Nature Type:__ Fire and Water  \n__From:__ Konohagakure (Leaf) \n__Rank:__ S-class Missing-Nin  \n__Registered Ninja #:__ 012110  \n__Affiliation:__ Akatsuki  \n__Ring:__ Shu (Red)  \n__Finger Position:__ Right Ring  \n__Partner:__ Hoshigaki Kisame  \n__Favorite Foods:__ Rice balls (kelp), cabbage  \n__Least Favorite Foods:__ Steak  \n__Hobby:__ Visiting traditional Japanese cafés \n __First Manga Appearance:__ Ch. 139 \n __First Anime Appearance:__ Ep. 80 \n __Assignments Completed:__ 53 D-Rank, 152 C-Rank, 134 B-Rank, 0 A-Rank, 1 S-Rank  \n__Famous Quote:__  _Foolish little brother, if you wish to kill me, hate me, detest me, and survive in an unsightly way.

He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.  Itachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi\'s prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.  He was praised highly by his father, who saw the family\'s future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi\'s younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.   ~!When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, Itachi, as an ANBU, was tasked with spying on the village. Knowing that a coup d\'etat would only lead to another Ninja War, Itachi chose to spy on the Uchiha instead, passing on information to the Third Hokage and the other Konoha elders. After this he began to act strangely, not attending the clan meetings, speaking out against the clan, and becoming the prime suspect for the murder of his best friend, Shisui Uchiha. The clan lost hope in Itachi, and his father began shifting his focus to Sasuke instead. Meanwhile, the Third\'s attempts to negotiate a bloodless end to hostilities between the two parties were proving ineffective, so, against the Third\'s wishes, Danzo and the Konoha Council ordered Itachi to wipe out the Uchiha.  Before the fateful night arrived, Itachi discovered the existence of Madara Uchiha, who was attempting to rekindle the flames of war in Konoha. In return for not attacking Konoha, Itachi offered to help Madara claim vengeance against the Uchiha for turning their backs on him decades earlier. Madara agreed. Itachi slaughtered his entire clan overnight, sparing only Sasuke. Sasuke\'s life was worth more than the village to Itachi, and he could not follow through with the orders to kill him as well. Instead, he made himself out as a villain, who had killed their innocent family only to test his abilities. By doing so, he wanted Sasuke to take vengeance on him and become a hero to Konoha, thus redeeming the Uchiha name. He tortured Sasuke with his Mangekyo Sharingan, and encouraged him to become strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Hoping that his beloved little brother would someday be powerful enough to kill him, Itachi left the village as a traitor.  Knowing that Konoha would still want to eliminate Sasuke, Itachi pleaded with the Third Hokage to keep Sasuke safe. He also threatened Danzo to not harm Sasuke or risk him revealing everything he knew about Konoha\'s secrets to enemy countries. Sasuke\'s safety was therefore secured, and Itachi returned to his original plan of becoming infamous for his slaughter of the Uchiha.   Itachi joined Akatsuki in order to keep an eye on the organization, along with Madara Uchiha, in case either ever acted against Konoha, all the while planning for his death at Sasuke\'s hands. While a member of Akatsuki, Itachi was approached by Orochimaru, who tried to steal his body to gain the Sharingan. Itachi trapped him in a genjutsu and severed his left hand as punishment, forcing Orochimaru to flee the organization. Sometime after joining Akatsuki, Itachi later helped recruit Deidara, Orochimaru\'s replacement, by beating him in battle, after which Deidara swore vengeance again.!~   \n\n~~~ __ _Personality___~~~  Ever since his first appearance, Itachi had always been mysterious, and had acted as though he was hiding his true self. While flashbacks to his past showed that he was a compassionate brother and person, his later acts and claims made it seem that this was mostly just an act. But, surprisingly, he genuinely was the compassionate brother he had once claimed to be, although he hid this from the rest of the Akatsuki to protect Sasuke.  As a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn\'t lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.  In addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.  Itachi\'s only initial interest was in Akatsuki\'s goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization\'s success and secrecy before everything else.As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.  However, when he was in a genjutsu duel during his fight with Sasuke, he cruelly claimed he had only let Sasuke live so that he could take Sasuke\'s eyes and obtain his own Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan, after which he then claimed the Uchiha clan had been nothing but tainted and evil, since many members would kill their friends to gain the Mangekyo Sharingan, and would take another Uchiha\'s eyes to make its power permanent. Once the genjutsu was released, he called it his true self, implying his calm, emotionless personality was also a facade. This persona was later revealed to be only an act to ensure that he would die by Sasuke\'s hands, his love for his younger brother being the fundamental aspect of his personality.   Despite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.  He, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi\'s hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi\'s most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.  When he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke\'s Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village (although, secretly, he was actually still loyal to his village).    \n\n~~~ __ _Abilities___~~~  Since a young age, Itachi\'s intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.   \n\n~~~ __ _Sharingan___~~~  Being of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent\'s movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent\'s genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels.    \n\n~~~ __ _Mangekyo Sharingan___~~~  Itachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent\'s mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata\'s Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi\'s mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.   ~!Despite his mastery of the Mangekyo Sharingan, Itachi suffered greatly from its side effects. His eyesight would worsen after every activation of the Mangekyo Sharingan, and he would eventually go blind from its power, with his Sharingan forever sealed away. Itachi was so close to blindness that, by the time he activated Susanoo in his final fight, both Sharingan eyes had become almost blind, and had turned white. However, he was still able to perform his own Fūinjutsu in his last moments.!~\n \n(Sources: Naruto.com and Naruto.wikia.com )','2020-10-19 11:29:52','2020-10-19 11:29:52','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n14-jr5pH4YLWDke.jpg','SC'),(1444,'Denka','Denka (デンカ) is a ninja cat that lives with Nekobaa at an Uchiha supply base.

After Naruto fails to graduate from the Academy, Mizuki tells Naruto that there is another way to graduate, and tricks him into stealing the forbidden scroll of sealings for him.  But as fate would have it, Mizuki shows up and pins Iruka to the wooden shack behind him. Mizuki then tells Naruto the truth about his past, the fact that he is the Demon Fox. Mizuki then attempts to kill both Naruto and Iruka, but luckily, Naruto uses the skill he learned from the scroll, Shadow Clone Jutsu, to create clones of himself which defeat Mizuki easily.  After that incident, Mizuki was imprisoned in the Konoha Strict Correctional Facility. Mizuki later on leads a prison revolt and sends the brothers, Fuujin and Raijin, to Orochimaru. During his escape, Mizuki remembers back to when Orochimaru gave him a cursed seal after a mission in which he killed his comrade. He was defeated by Naruto\'s Rasengan.

When his extensions are open and his head is visible, it is revealed that Zetsu has two different colored halves of his body, the left side completely white and the right side black. To go with this, Zetsu seems to have a split personality, as in the Japanese version of the manga the black half of his face speaks only in Katakana while the white side uses Kanji and Kana, and in the English episodes the black side has a different voice actor than the white side. The two halves also converse with each other, and occasionally differ in opinion (the black half is more serious and intelligent while the white half is carefree and easygoing). They also seem to communicate with their thoughts. To further his venus fly trap theme, Zetsu is a cannibal.   Zetsu is seemingly very trustworthy, being entrusted with knowledge of Pain and Tobi\'s identities. He has apparently been working with the latter for some time, Tobi first appearing as his \"subordinate\" and Zetsu later commenting that Tobi\'s plans have been in the works for a long time.   Zetsu\'s main role within the Akatsuki is to function as a spy, often acting as a hunter-nin for Akatsuki. He has been shown able to move his body and take part in the tailed beasts sealing ritual imultaneously which, in addition to being unique to him, allows him to act as a lookout while the sealing takes place. When an agent to Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, dies, Zetsu is sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed. Zetsu is also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members. Due to the role he plays, Zetsu is the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. Despite this, Zetsu serves as a sort of superior to other members, as they often report directly to him instead of the actual leader, Pain.

With his parents and family now gone his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.   After his fight with Naruto he believes he\'s been wasting his time \'playing ninja\' with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can revenge his clan by killing Itachi and then to restore the Uchiha clan.  As a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.   Claiming at first that he doesn\'t need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. He openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.   Sasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.  \n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke\'s clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.  \n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that\'s open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming).

Generally, she opts to think carefully before acting, as seen when she stalls her confession to Ichijou in consideration that he may have feelings for Kirisaki.  \n\nIn confrontation with Ichijou, Onodera displays inconfidence, initially needing encouragement from Miyamoto to attempt confessing her love.  \n\nOnodera works well with her classmates, possessing close friends and being the most popular girl for the boys before Kirisaki transferred and after Kirisaki and Ichijou allegedly began dating.   \n\nBoth Kosaki and Ichijou are completely unaware that the feelings they hold for each other are mutual. Like in many average fictional love stories, these two try not to show their feelings to each other. She loves Raku because he is kind and caring. Just like the other girls who like him, she can be jealous as well but not to the point of having bloodlust. She often worries/wonders whether Raku and Chitoge\'s \"fake relationship\" is actually developing into something more than just that. \n\nChitoge and Onodera have a really trusting relationship. It can even be considered that they are best friends since Chitoge only tells her problems to her (except in some cases, Raku as well). Despite her knowing that Chitoge and Raku are only pretending to date, she at times can\'t help but be suspicious of their relationship. \n\n(Source: Nisekoi Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:30:00','2020-10-19 11:30:00','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b52723-YbLFn4JmoAVQ.png','MC'),(1465,'Raku Ichijou','Son of a Yakuza family.

Three years before the story line, Saitama had spiky, black hair and brown eyes.

His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt.

Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn\'t take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it\'s too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and \'unimpressive\' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic.

He hates being insulted and will attack or kill any who offend him. He thinks highly of himself and uses that assertion to threaten high ranking personal such as heroes and Shicchi. He does not consider other human villains to be allies, wiping out a large group of them along with the heroes present.

He claims to have lost all of his hair suddenly and prematurely as a result of the toll taken on his body by intense hero training. Three years before the story line, Saitama had spiky, black hair and brown eyes.  Saitama is usually deliberately drawn in a simpler style than other characters, with a very rounded head and only a simple mouth and eyes. When drawn in a more \'action-oriented\' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by a red ensemble of boots, gloves and a cape.\n\nPersonality: For a superhero, Saitama is rather laid-back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn\'t take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it\'s too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and \'unimpressive\' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms before suddenly and nonchalantly obliterating them with one punch.\n\n(Source: One Punch-Man Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:30:30','2020-10-19 11:30:30','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/73935-WX4ViYPuZhs5.jpg','MC'),(1572,'Handsome Kamen Amai Mask','_Race:_ Human~!?!~ _Age:_ 24 _Occupation:_ Superhero _Level:_ A-Class; Rank 1.  \n\n Sweet Mask is a tall and lean-built young man with messy, shoulder-length light blue hair and yellow eyes.

He also genuinely cares for the well-being of the citizens around him and actually wishes happiness upon every living thing in the universe. However, befitting the darker side of Sweet Mask\'s name is his hidden merciless nature. He is shown to have a burning hatred for anything that he sees as evil. Anything that he declares as evil must be swiftly and thoroughly exterminated. \n\nSweet Mask is shown to adhere to any method that makes heroes popular. He notes that only promotions to S-Class or A-Class are fit for his attention, as they are the heroes who draw the most attention from the public, and hence, any heroes in those ranks who earn themselves negative reputations would drag his reputation down as well. Because of this, Sweet Mask stays in the A-Class Rank 1 position to prevent unworthy heroes from promoting to S-Class. \n\nSweet Mask is very narcissistic about \"beauty overwhelming the power\", as he said about his philosophy that \"heroes have to be beautiful as well\".

He is regarded as one of the Forty-One Supreme Beings by the NPCs of the Great Tomb of Nazarick. He is the creator of Sebas Tian. At some point in YGGDRASIL, Touch Me participated in an official martial tournament and defeated all of his adversaries. By winning the tournament, he was awarded a special prize that comes in two. Firstly, he was given a special job class known as the \"World Champion\" of Álfheimr, and in addition he was awarded with the pure white armor set called \"Compliance with Law.\"\n\nTouch Me\'s outfit consists of shining white armor and a helm. His chest piece contains a huge sapphire embedded in the middle, which radiates with pure and divine light.\nHe is also adorned with a reddish cape attached around his right shoulder. Additionally, he is armed with both sword and shield. Touch Me\'s actual facial appearance in real life is said to look exactly like Sebas Tian. \n\nAs Touch Me played YGGDRASIL, he decided to assist the heteromorphic players during a time when they were being hunted down for fun through PKing. Thus, that was how he met Momonga, by saving him from a PK party; the two started becoming friends since then. There was also a time when Bukubukuchagama could not find a party to adventure with due to her appearance, so he was the one who approached her before anyone else. Afterwards, they formed a party together with other non-human characters and organized the First Nine, also known as Nine\'s Own Goal.\n\nAfter that, the clan grew with members chosen and invited personally by Touch Me, becoming a stable and friendly group. However, he felt that the clan was beginning to slowly fall apart. During one of its meetings, Touch Me was seen looking troubled by Momonga and Peroroncino, but their concerns were brushed aside. Once all the clan members had arrived, Touch Me started the meeting by having Nishikienrai report his latest discovery of a new unexplored dungeon. After the various clan members discussed the pros and cons of the dungeon, it was agreed that the clan would launch a raid.  Touch Me then moved unto the next point in the agenda of the meeting, in which he formally announced his intention to dissolve the Clan. His declaration elicited many protests, however he informed them that he wished to form Nine\'s Own Goal as an official Guild. Hearing the majority of the Clan concur to the idea, Touch Me decided to turn down the suggestion to become the Guildmaster. Just as several members of the groups argued about who should become Guildmaster, Touch Me restored order and nominated Momonga as their new guild leader, a proposal which many accepted. \n\nTouch Me is looked upon as very righteous and fair. He would help people in times of trouble without hesitation, and scolds his friends if one of them did something wrong. Momonga describes Touch Me as someone who is a straightforward person, the kind who was very direct in his words and deeds. However, Touch Me can be self-reflective at times, as evidenced when he was willing to step down as clan leader and proposed for someone else to be the guild master rather than him. If what Ulbert said is true; about him chasing away one of their former clansman leaving the game, then this might be part of the reason why Touch Me decided to step down voluntarily as a candidate for Guildmaster. \n\n(Source: Overlord Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:30:38','2020-10-19 11:30:38','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/127437-HHvKoQEugGhN.jpg','SC'),(1602,'Narberal Gamma','One of the Pleiades, combat maids of the Tenth floor under Sebas Tian.

Thus, that was how he met Momonga, by saving him from a PK party; the two started becoming friends since then. There was also a time when Bukubukuchagama could not find a party to adventure with due to her appearance, so he was the one who approached her before anyone else. Afterwards, they formed a party together with other non-human characters and organized the First Nine, also known as Nine\'s Own Goal.\n\nAfter that, the clan grew with members chosen and invited personally by Touch Me, becoming a stable and friendly group. However, he felt that the clan was beginning to slowly fall apart. During one of its meetings, Touch Me was seen looking troubled by Momonga and Peroroncino, but their concerns were brushed aside. Once all the clan members had arrived, Touch Me started the meeting by having Nishikienrai report his latest discovery of a new unexplored dungeon. After the various clan members discussed the pros and cons of the dungeon, it was agreed that the clan would launch a raid.  Touch Me then moved unto the next point in the agenda of the meeting, in which he formally announced his intention to dissolve the Clan. His declaration elicited many protests, however he informed them that he wished to form Nine\'s Own Goal as an official Guild. Hearing the majority of the Clan concur to the idea, Touch Me decided to turn down the suggestion to become the Guildmaster. Just as several members of the groups argued about who should become Guildmaster, Touch Me restored order and nominated Momonga as their new guild leader, a proposal which many accepted. \n\nTouch Me is looked upon as very righteous and fair. He would help people in times of trouble without hesitation, and scolds his friends if one of them did something wrong. Momonga describes Touch Me as someone who is a straightforward person, the kind who was very direct in his words and deeds. However, Touch Me can be self-reflective at times, as evidenced when he was willing to step down as clan leader and proposed for someone else to be the guild master rather than him. If what Ulbert said is true; about him chasing away one of their former clansman leaving the game, then this might be part of the reason why Touch Me decided to step down voluntarily as a candidate for Guildmaster. \n\n(Source: Overlord Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:30:48','2020-10-19 11:30:48','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/127437-HHvKoQEugGhN.jpg','MC'),(1638,'Tina','Tina is an adamantite ranked adventurer and a member of Blue Rose.

He changes to a much friendlier person that starts to think that strength is more than simply being skilled with a sword.\n\nIn his second encounter with Shalltear, he managed to chip off Shalltear\'s pinky fingernail using Fourfold Slash of Light.\n\nIn the web novel version, he becomes a vampire under Shalltear.!~\n\n(Source: Overlord Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:30:54','2020-10-19 11:30:54','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n128263-KwhoIxlYfLET.jpg','SC'),(1668,'Luvellia Sanctus','','2020-10-19 11:30:54','2020-10-19 11:30:54','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164447-VRYIQ3kTi2UJ.png','MC'),(1669,'Peter Grill','','2020-10-19 11:30:54','2020-10-19 11:30:54','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164448-9ykwj2VxZbNt.png','MC'),(1670,'Lisa Alpacas','','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164452-P1A0bR0RiNIE.png','SC'),(1671,'John Goodman','The [Guildmaster\'s](https://anilist.co/character/184904) assistant.','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b184902-LXn5mjBKDRrq.png','MC'),(1672,'Mimi Alpacas','','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164451-l4upvXktf6dz.png','MC'),(1673,'Albatross Sanctus','[Luvellia\'s](https://anilist.co/character/164447) father and guild master.','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b184904-qHXZD6Z82J6l.png','SC'),(1674,'Vegan Eldoriel','','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164450-VOdbFDNDMNPg.png','SC'),(1675,'Piglette Pancetta','','2020-10-19 11:30:55','2020-10-19 11:30:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b164449-nJvtX30daiKA.png','MC'),(1676,'Worm Goblin','','2020-10-19 11:30:56','2020-10-19 11:30:56','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b184908-7BCAFOdwl1Io.png','MC'),(1677,'Tim Robinson','','2020-10-19 11:30:56','2020-10-19 11:30:56','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b184903-iPKe9WMN3IyQ.png','MC'),(1678,'Narrator','This character page is set to represent and list all narrators, which haven\'t been given a visual representation of themselves in their respective work. \n\nPlease add other narrator characters, which were given a visual representation of themselves, separately from this narrator page.

Because it was engineered to be the ultimate in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. In the first movie, where it was shown to be capable of levitation, telepathy, and mind control, Mewtwo exemplified these vicious characteristics. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic.

Her outfit consists of a white wide-necked sweater with blue sleeves over a black tank top, a short plaid yellow skirt which is part of the Yokai Academy&#039;s girls&#039; uniform, pink and violet stockings (her right stocking slightly longer than her left), and a belt that is wrapped around her left thigh.   Mizore returns to school after a delayed absence and was first portrayed as a lonely, somewhat depressed, and misunderstood girl. She becomes infatuated with Tsukune, going so far as to create her own journal/scrapbook with all of his newspaper articles.   In the past, she confessed her love to a teacher until he began taking advantage of her, freezing him as a result. With the incident and rumors spreading about her, Mizore made it hard for herself to trust anyone, but took a liking to Tsukune, believing he was just as miserable as she was. She eventually regains her sense of trust after Tsukune intervenes when the same teacher returns to kill her. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis (from around 340 spying locations, according to her). She initially sports long hair in her debut appearances, but cuts it short after the incident was cleared. Later in the second serialization, Mizore decides that even if Tsukune doesn&#039;t fall in love with her, she will follow him forever.  A running gag in the series is that Mizore always appears unexpectedly in the oddest locations (under tables, behind doors, the ceiling, bushes, and even in the bathroom), and freezes any girl to disrupt any sort of tender moment Tsukune is having with the latter.   Keeping in line with her kind, Mizore has the ability to control snow and ice at will, and while doing so, shapes claws of ice around her hands (her hair becomes ice on rare occasions). She can also make almost perfect copies (if a bit fragile) of herself and others with it as well, each capable of independent thought.

Her hate for humans stems from a car accident caused by a human drunk driver that took her parents\' lives while the family was vacationing in the human world. Upon remembering the kind of love her parents had given her, she attempts to persuade her mistress to call off her plan but to no avail, as her mistress was bent on destroying the human world. She disappears after her mistress is defeated and put to rest, and reappears when Tsukune becomes out of control as a ghoul, aiding Mikogami in sealing his abilities. She now resides at Yōkai Academy as Mikogami\'s aide and continues to work for him in the second manga serialization. Despite not being an official student, she receives permission to become a member of the Newspaper Club. Exclusively in the anime, a running gag involves her randomly switching positions to help the school. When asked why, she states \"many many things\" have happened, though it is believed these are orders from Mikogami as a debt of gratitude for providing her with a new magic wand.  It is later revealed in an omake that the reason why Ruby works under Mikogami is because of her infatuation with Tsukune, and by working at the academy, she could be near him. The anime omits the presence of her master or the inclusion of her parents, drastically changing the events surrounding her, including the reasons behind her return. Much of Ruby\'s magic revolves around a motif of ravens and flora, both as familiars and alternate forms for her to take, her most notable form being her having six raven wings with razor-sharp feathers on her back. Apparently, Ruby has shown that she is a masochist and the biggest pervert of them all during a training exercise for Tsukune to control his ghoul powers, even admitting to Tsukune a desire to be his \"toy\" while under the Lilith Mirror\'s influence. However, she also appears to have some feelings toward Ginei, as she undergoes \'private photo sessions\' of him taking pictures of her in her underwear.

She is a witch who dons a typical witch costume (consisting of a hat and cape), which is considered by some students to be a violation of the school rules, and frequently ends her sentences with \"desu\", which roughly translates to \"it is\". However, it can also have the effect of raising the politeness of one\'s speech. As a witch, she has problems with her classmates discriminating against her (according to Kurumu, witches are viewed as \"Beings of the Borderline\", those that are something between humans and the supernatural, as it is impossible to tell their difference by appearance alone).   Despite ranking #1 on the examinations, she was a lonely prankster before meeting Tsukune and Moka. She initially hated Tsukune, claiming that she has fallen in love with Moka, and uses her magical powers to try to drive them apart. However, after both Tsukune and Moka save her from bullying classmates, she falls for him too, and her obsession with both has driven her to try to create a three-way relationship between them.   Despite her genius IQ, Yukari is very childish in nature, and is often indecisive on whether or not she either loves Tsukune or Moka more than the other. Though it seems that despite her young age, Yukari might be bisexual, as she still has interest in Tsukune as well as Moka. This action was displayed in an omake when Kurumu asks Yukari a similar question to which Yukari answers both, only for her to choose Moka.  She often clashes with Kurumu, often teasing her about her large breasts, but they often team up on some occasions, such as the case in the Witch\'s Knoll arc, and are in reality friendly rivals. In the anime, she is the only girl of the group to actually kiss Tsukune.  As a witch, Yukari can cast various spells through her heart-shaped magic wand, her motif usually revolving around tarot cards and washtubs. She can also use her wand to manipulate various objects and use them as weapons, as with the case where she uses brooms to drive away Tsukune in her introductory chapter. A running gag throughout the series is where she often drops a washtub on someone who is annoying, usually Kurumu or Mizore (and Gin on rare occasions).   Yukari is quite powerful as a witch and has great potential given the right motivation, one instance is when she defeats an army of monster plants by herself during the Witch\'s Knoll arc.   Yukari has, on occasion, developed some bizarre items, such as the Gro-Gro Drops for Kokoa, often leading to hilarious results or farfetched situations. Her parents, both highly skilled and adept in magic, appear during the start of the school festival seen in the anime adaptation, when they repair the torn-up academy.','2020-10-19 11:31:55','2020-10-19 11:31:55','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b3864-TD9TDMym6tKt.png','SC'),(1828,'Ririko Kagome','Ririko Kagome is a bespectacled math teacher at Yokai Academy and a lamia appearing in chapter 12 of the first serialization. Seemingly innocent and deeply concerned for her students\' grades, she offers private lessons to anyone willing, though at a price (according to Kurumu, Ririko tends to go overboard with her tutoring, and envies her for her large breasts). As such, she uses her abilities to drain her students\' emotions in exchange for knowledge, which is done through a flower-like appendage on her tail. She also seems to have a fetish for S&amp;M outfits, claiming that it makes her male students \"work harder\".However, this might be only what she thinks in her warped mind.  In both the manga and anime series, Ririko tries to enslave Tsukune when he is forced to have tutoring by her in order to correct his failing grades in math, and believes that Moka is in the way of his studies (she caught Moka trying to suck Tsukune\'s blood, but misinterpreted it). But when Moka attempts to rescue him, Tsukune snaps out of Ririko\'s control long enough to remove Moka\'s rosario, leading to her defeat by Moka\'s vampire form (she was given a two-week suspension according to Tsukune, meaning she will be allowed to return to work, unlike Ishigami).  She reappears later in chapter 19, apparently not holding a grudge, to warn Tsukune and Moka about Okuto Kotsubo. While she no longer bears a grudge against Moka in the manga, her grudge against her remains in the anime, shown when she attempted to take Moka hostage only to be stopped by Nekonome in a catwoman costume. Also, her anime incarnation is slightly more perverse than her manga counterpart. It is important to note that unlike other antagonists, she is not inherently evil, but rather very passionate about the education of the academy\'s students as well as the status between teachers and students.

She\'s the first person Tsukune met when he first set foot on the monster realm. Moka\'s true form is a vampire but she is very sweet and kind. She takes a liking to Tsukune after sucking his blood and seems to get addicted on doing so.  The reason Moka wears a rosary around her neck is due to her \'inner self\'. When her rosary around her neck is removed (to date Tsukune is the only one capable of removing it), the seal that was keeping her true nature is released. A few physical changes occur, signifying her transformation into a super vampire. Her hair turns silver, her pupils turn to slits, along with a corresponding flash of light. More important than any superficial change, Moka\'s inner personality rises to the surface. Cold and bloodthirsty, the \'inner\' Moka is actually a completely different entity from the \'outer\' Moka, even going so far as to specifically remind Tsukune to \'be kind to the other Moka\'.  Moka is also one of the most popular girls around the school so she gets a lot of attention around the guys, but she pays them no attention with the exception of Tsukune (much to the guys\' dismay). Moka is an excellent student, ranking 13th overall on the school exams, and also a member of the Newspaper Club.

She bears a great contempt for humans, as she and her fellow witches of her time have suffered through a long period of humans expanding their terriitory, and seeks revenge against them by destroying the city nearby with her army of monster plants after land developers attempt to turn her home into a garbage dump. Despite Tsukune\'s pleas for him to help her, she refuses to allow anyone to further harm her home, and tried to kill Moka until Tsukune removes her rosario while going through an army of Hanabake plants. During her fight with Inner Moka, she uses a forbidden spell to merge herself with the Hanabake plants. Although she gains the upper hand in battle absorbing Moka\'s vampiric powers, she was in a brief state of shock when Ruby injures herself while blocking the finishing blow that was meant for the latter, and absorbed her to gain her powers. She was soon defeated in battle when Moka impales the crystal in her spellbook with Ruby\'s wand, and was killed in the following explosion. While she was being whisked away by Ruby in a dream, she admits her true feelings to her, saying that she did not want her to be taken away from the humans.  In the Anime adaptation, she dies prior to Ruby meeting the Newspaper Club, but saw the errors of her ideas of revenge on humans beforehand. Her body still remained in their house as Ruby\'s mind fractured after being unable to cope with her death; a split personality used her image to relay orders to Ruby. However, her spirit is assumed to have been what saved Ruby from dying in the explosion of the monster plants and safely kept her above the waves of the ocean until Gin and the Bus Driver found her.  Much of Oyakata\'s magic revolves around flora, and she can extend vines from her fingers to use as an offensive weapon. Like Ruby, she can use ravens as familiars to serve as messengers. When fused with the Hanabake plants, she gains the ability of regeneration, rendering any physical attack useless. She can also absorb other living creatures and gain use of their abilities.

Tsukune Aono is a young man who has failed all of his high school entrance exams. With no options left for him, his parents sends him to Yōkai Academy. Upon arriving there however, he soon discovers that it is a special school for monsters and demons alike, and any human who discovers its existience will be killed. Fearing for his life, he later meets Moka Akashiya, a beautiful girl who turns out to be a vampire. Soon after he becomes friends with her, he soon learns from her that she hates humans. After revealing his secret to Moka to the latter\'s shock, he then decides to return to the human world, but relents at the last minute when he comes to rescue her from a bullying student, stating that he really likes her and wants to become her friend. Soon after the misunderstanding was cleared, he decides to stay at Yokai Academy regardless of the impending danger that awaits him.  Though considerate and polite, Tsukune is a gentle person even though there have been many instances, where he has been put into dangerous, life-threatening situations (many of which are due to enemies whom he later befriends), he has never held a grudge against anyone. Tsukune\'s selflessness and courage comes to the foreground, whenever he or someone from his group of friends is faced with the possibility of injury, or even death. Though powerless, he has the tendency of throwing himself into danger to ensure the safety of his friends. As the series progresses, this habit becomes extremely dangerous the enemies he encounters are so powerful that he frequently comes close to dying. Ironically, this leads to a situation where he calls upon \"his own\" supernatural abilities (originally from Inner Moka) as well as the concealment of his human identity from much of the student body.

She tries to seduce Tsukune and the male student body, using her charming techniques (through her succubi abilities, including her busty physique), making them her slaves. This is so she can find her \"mate of fate\", in order to save her diminishing species, with the assumption that Moka is blocking her path. After Tsukune persuades the unsealed Moka to spare her, she becomes infatuated with him and makes a decision that he will be her \"mate of fate\", becoming friends with the pair.  While she does continue to tease and try to seduce Tsukune, it is clear that she possesses true and honest feelings for him- she\'s been shown to be willing to risk her life for him numerous times throughout the anime and manga. In the manga, Kurumu is shown to be a kind and soft-hearted girl who loves her rivals for Tsukune\'s love like sisters, tenderly comforting and supporting them in their moments of sadness, as well as defending them when they are in danger. This kind-hearted character-trait is downplayed in the anime in favor of a more typical \"flirt\" character, although the kind-heartedness is still present, and in reality, she is actually an innocent character. Despite this, an often running gag in both series is when she uses her breasts to seduce Tsukune, which, more often than not, makes his nose bleed and causes him to suffocate. She also attempts to use baked sweets laced with love potions to secure his affections, though they never seem to reach him. Also, no matter where they are, she somehow manages to interfere with any tender moment between Tsukune and Moka, often by appearing when least expected.  In an omake, Kurumu reveals she has a serious weakness for sweets, to the extent that she once ate poisoned cookies that she made and planned to give to Moka. The incident seems to have bought her some control over this trait, as the aforementioned love sweets are intact whenever they appear. Described as a tough character, Kurumu sports a pair of bat wings, tail and razor-sharp nails in her true form, and has notable body strength (seen when carrying people during flight). The use of illusions and reality-bending techniques make up for her lack of combat abilities. Kurumu also carries a unique, innate sense of knowing when danger might occur.

She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.\n\nEmilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.\n\n__Emilia\'s Backstory:__\n~! About a century ago, Emilia lived with her aunt on her father\'s side in Elior Forest. Back then for reasons not known to her she was considered a rather special child spent most of her days isolated from the other eleven villagers in a place called the \"Princess Room\" with only Fortuna, her doll and spirits for company. While she normally obeyed her aunt and loved her, deep down a part of Emilia resented her and the village for stripping her of freedom, constantly hiding things from her. Eventually, young Emilia\'s frustrations reached a boiling point and in an act of defiance, she breaks her promise to not leave her room in order to gain her freedom. Free to do what she wanted and not hold obligations that were never explained to her, Emilia would sneak out on many occasions while hiding the fact, doing everything from exploring to behaving mischievously as these were the times she would not have played the obedient \"good girl\" which helped in relieving her of loneliness. Until the day she met Geuse in a chance encounter whom she formed a strong friendship and whom would act not unlike something like a father figure. One day, Pandora and Regulus Corneas attacked Elior Forest to open the Seal within the deepest part of it, following into the death of Fortuna, the madness of Geuse. Emilia enraged when she saw the corpse of Fortuna who was killed by Pandora\'s powers and froze the whole forest, along with the citizens and Emilia herself. Emilia would blame herself for what happened as a consequence of breaking the taboos of the forest for personal desires and choosing to oppose Pandora to keep her promise with Fortuna which led to losing her aunt and Geuse.\n\nOver seven years before the start of the selection, Puck unfroze Emilia and began to live with her in the now snow-covered Elior Forest. Exposed to the outside world for some time now, Emilia came to face the hostile reality of what it meant to be a half-elf in the world, especially one with her appearance. From that time on, she suffered many hardships, not just from neighborhood human towns that feared her, hated her, betrayed her, and attempted to sell her into slavery but even from higher beings such as The Great Spirit of Fire who sought to exterminate her for the crime of her existence and dangerous power that slept on within her. Because of these issues, Emilia minimized any contact with outsiders, sticking to a frugal life by only leaving the forest to trade the magic stones she could find within with people willing to deal with her in humans\' towns for food and clothing. Humans who called her the \"Witch of Frost\" mostly tried to avoid her when she came around, but other than these excursions, Emilia would otherwise stay with the frozen elves as a guardian as they were connected to her past. After the harrowing incident with Melakuera, Emilia formed a contract with Puck to preserve his life after his Od had been damaged. Puck then began to act as her surrogate father and mentor. Puck used the contract itself to seal parts of her memories that had been tampered with by Pandora.\n\nA year before Subaru arrived she and Puck encountered Roswaal, the first human who didn\'t react negatively to her appearance. He then invited her to the Royal Selection after being chosen by the Dragon by giving her a way to save the citizens of Elior Forest, by using the dragon blood. Though now after experiencing the harsh state that she and other demi-humans have gone through, she also hopes to become a ruler that can mend relations between them and humans that the Witch of Envy destroyed with her reign of terror long ago. !~\n\n__Emilia\'s Abilities__\n~! __Spirit Affinity__: She has a rare innate gift to form contracts with spirits.\n\n__Spirit User__: Emilia is currently contracted with several Quasi Spirits and was formerly contracted with the Artificial Spirit Puck. During the incident at the Sanctuary, Puck broke his contract with her, causing her existing pendant to shatter, and she temporarily carried him around in a crystal stone that wasn\'t pure enough for her to use him properly. She later replaces her pendant with a new high purity crystal stone following the events at Priestella, however she states that she still doesn\'t have enough mana to form a new contract. Puck himself was a Human before he was made into an Artificial Spirit by Echidna and has some sort of contract with her that seals his former memories unless a certain condition is met. Some of Emilia\'s contract conditions are:\n\n- He will be active only from 9 am to 5 pm\n- Do not ask his relationship with Beatrice\n- Do not look into a mirror or go near a large body of water\n- Do not hide the fact that you are a half-elf\n- He will choose your hairstyle every morning\n- Groom his fur regularly\n- Have some exercise when you wake up and before going to bed.\n- Do not be picky about food\n- Talk with lesser spirits every morning and evening\n\n__Spirit Arts__: Emilia is capable of using this with Puck and her other spirits. Emilia and Puck can smoothly alternate between roles of offense and defense leading to devastating results. These include changing the atmosphere in the sky to rain down multitudes of ice spears, forming ice clones that are capable of attacking and using magic, instantly conjuring giant freezing blade discs, mist barriers that hide her presence and ice shields. On top of that Emilia is contracted to several Quasi Spirits; she can use them for various applications such as healing.\n\n__Equipment__ : Emilia wields a magical crystal known as a Pyroxene Crystal. After the fight between Roswaal and Ram, she received another Pyroxene Crystal from Subaru, which he got from Frederica Baumann. Currently, she keeps Puck within it and now is able to control the Lewes Meyer Copies to serve her.\n\n__Magic User__: Following the trials, Emilia remembered that she could use magic without Puck, and becomes able to use it again. It also made her aware of the abnormal amount of mana flowing through her. She is able to use ice magic through her natural fire attribute like her aunt Fortuna, to convert heat into ice.\n\n__Huma__: Emilia creates a shining water barrier that blocks other projectiles and sorts of magic. However, if the incoming magic is stronger than the shield it will get through it and cause damage to the user.\n\n__UI Huma__: Emilia summons massive ice pillars from thin air and hurls to it\'s target. It\'s capable of destroying an entire building.\n\n__Al Huma__: Emilia creates a sharp ten meter long spear of ice. The spear can also be modified to trap enemies.\n__Ice Brand Arts__: This technique allows Emilia to instantly conjure ice made weapons which she can use and freely manipulate in close-quarters combat. The weapons are very sturdy and are even capable of withstanding heat.\n\n__Ice Brand Arts__: Icicle Line: Emilia creates a limited area barrier made of ice particles around her opponent which she uses to attack in all directions by transforming them into weapons. Subaru helped in create the idea for this move.\n\n__Ice Flower__: Emilia creates flowers made of ice on wounds of living beings within a certain area that suck the host\'s life force and bloom by sucking the host\'s blood. Seven years ago, Emilia couldn\'t control the effect area and stop it properly. Puck had to use his powers to terminate it.\n\n__Melee Fighter__: While she leans more on the magical side, Emilia is also apt at close-quarters combat. Like Garfiel rather than having a known practiced form, she is a more instinctual fighter, relying on her body\'s natural talents such as its high nimbleness, sharp senses and above-average physical strength combined with her magical arts. This creates her own unique style. !~','2020-10-19 11:32:01','2020-10-19 11:32:01','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b88572-v2KimyNuU4XZ.jpg','MC'),(1857,'Subaru Natsuki ','__Age:__ 18 (17 in Arc 1-4)\n__Birthday:__ April 1\n__Height:__ 173 cm (5\'8\")\n\nOn the way home from the convenience store, he suddenly finds himself transported into another world.

Crusch was born as the only daughter and heir to Karsten family, one of the most powerful noble families in Lugnica. Even as child she considered an oddity among the nobility for being mature more than other children her age. Moreso as a girl who favored things like weapons over finery. As she grew older Crusch would developed a preference for men\'s clothing, and take on more masculine pursuits like learning swordplay which earned rumors about her from other nobles. Crusch held a strong fascination with history of Lion Kings (獅子王 Shishiou) which would come to serve as the basis for her radical but conflicted ideas about Lugunica present state. Her close friendships with both Fourier and Ferris would further have a huge influence on these aspects of herself and facilitate finding the balance between Crusch as a woman and Crusch the as noble she felt needed to become lead House Karsten.\n\nOn Crusch\'s 17th birthday an incident with Great Rabbit occured in the Karsten lands. Her efforts and leadership there would latter play a crucial role in her father passing down the position as the of head of family to her couple weeks afterward. Several years later, Crusch would catch wind of trouble afoot at House Arygle, through an report by her advisers. Not wanting this to burden Ferris whom still had trauma from his time with the Argyles nor let what was happening affect her attendant\'s standing among the knights in a very delicate period that would decide his future, Crusch would endeavor to take of the problem quietly herself and confer with Fourier to keep Ferris away from it.\n\nCrusch would directly head to Argyle estate to confront Biehn Argyle and Miles to learn the truth of the matter. After a tense conversation Crusch would fall into a trap she is drugged by the scent of odorless poison in the tea she had been given. She would find herself held in the same underground cell Ferris had lived in for years before his rescue by her. After a conversation with Biehn, Hannah Regret would later appear to loosen her manacles so she could escape when it was time. Crusch still completely unsure which side she was on would inquire about her motives and why she was betraying him. Hannah would only mention that it was out of love and Crusch wouldn\'t understand. It was at this point Crusch noticed the similarities between Hannah\'s appearance and Ferris, but the maid would leave before she could ask. Miles would soon visit Crusch himself intending break her will in preparation to make off with her and Ferris later, only for Crusch to reverse the situation to his shock by cutting him and the corpse soldiers around down. She then meet up with Julius in in the manor\'s first floor and then a distraught and shaken Ferris. The three would escape the blazing inferno the place had become.\n\nA year later, due to her increasing amount of workload brought about by royal family being unable to forfil their duties, Crusch found little time to visit Fourier after he fallen ill to the unknown epidemic sweeping through the palace. Eventually, one day during one her rare visits she brought Fourier out to gardens in the palace courtyard unbeknownst to her his would be the last time the two would speak. Reminiscing about the old days and reaffirming their childhood promise Fourier would die suddenly, but peacefully. During day the same day the current king would be the last royal to succumbed ending the Lugnica line.

It was there then that the Dragon Insignia as well as prophecy regarding the next step the country should take would be revealed. Crusch be discovered as first of the five potential candidates deeded worthy to lead the country. Learning this with strong conviction, Crusch would return to garden where Fourier died with Ferris and vow to forever server the tie between the dragon and Lugncia whose influence she become convinced had distorted the way Lugnica should be. !~\n\nCrusch is a beautiful woman with amber eyes and long dark green hair that reaches to the middle of her back.

She is already the head of her family, finishing her work better than her father. She prefers to act herself and has the pride of a warrior. Crusch is also gentle, often believing the false knowledge jokingly told to her by Ferris, and sometimes displays an airheaded side. Like her mother Helena Karsten, she is shown to be ruthless and reckless.\n\nCrusch is also dense toward any feelings of love above kindness, often not understanding why certain people behave a certain way, such as when she sometimes didn\'t understand Fourier\'s behavior.

She looks nearly identical to her sister Rem apart from her hair, eyes, and ribbon coloring. She usually wears a maid uniform. She has a smaller chest compared to her sister, and she has slanted eyes. Ram is seemingly self-centered and does things at her own pace, however in actuality she maintains a distance from people to ascertain them. She believes that Roswaal is the greatest and no one else is as precious except for her sister Rem. She is slightly more outgoing in comparison to the generally taciturn Rem, who generally allows Ram to take the lead in their sisterly bond.\n~! As the prodigal elder twin Ram was born with extraordinary talent for mana manipulation and a powerful body to match that made her the pride of the Oni village. Her aptitude didn\'t just lie there, everything from cooking to physical activities she was superior to Rem and was showered in adoration even by her own sister. However she never let any of it get to her head and never forgot her little sister no matter how much attention was paid to her. During the night of the attack by the Witch Cult when all the Oni fell she alone kept fighting to avenge them and protect her sister. But the cult outnumbered her and she made a last ditch effort to shield a petrified Rem from getting cut down. In mere moments, Ram lost her horn when it was sliced off from her head as a result of that. Had it not been for a passing mage at the time whom they came to know as Roswaal L Mathers they would not have survived the massacre.\nThe next several years since then Roswaal would gain the twins eternal gratitude and fervent loyalty.

Ram is the only person who knows about Roswaal\'s gospel and had formed a contract with him that stipulated that his life would be hers if the future ever deviated from it\'s predictions as penance for knowing about the attack and letting it happen for his own ends. !~','2020-10-19 11:32:05','2020-10-19 11:32:05','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b88576-fjTlmKcRsBxS.png','SC'),(1875,'Emilia ','__Age:__ 19 (18 in Arc 1 - 4), 15 (14 in Arc 1 - 4) (mental)\n~!108 (107 in Arc 1 - 4) (actual)!~\n\n__Date of Birth:__ September 23\n__Height:__ 164 cm (5\'5\")\n\nThe main female protagonist. She is a silver-haired half-elf girl who is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election. Subaru first meets her when her insignia is stolen by Felt as she needs to possess it to be eligible to participate in the election. She introduces herself as Satella when she and Subaru met during the first timeline before introducing herself by her real name when she got her insignia back.\n\nEmilia is good natured and likes to take care of others, though she herself refuses to admit it, instead thinking of it as her own selfishness. She is indifferent to her own appearance, leaving Puck to take care of her clothes and hair. Because her appearance is similar to the Witch of Envy, she has received unfair discrimination from others. She sometimes acts like a child and is unacquainted with the world as she used to live in the woods with other Elves, though despite this she still works hard to become a ruler.\n\n__Emilia\'s Backstory:__\n~! About a century ago, Emilia lived with her aunt on her father\'s side in Elior Forest. Back then for reasons not known to her she was considered a rather special child spent most of her days isolated from the other eleven villagers in a place called the \"Princess Room\" with only Fortuna, her doll and spirits for company. While she normally obeyed her aunt and loved her, deep down a part of Emilia resented her and the village for stripping her of freedom, constantly hiding things from her. Eventually, young Emilia\'s frustrations reached a boiling point and in an act of defiance, she breaks her promise to not leave her room in order to gain her freedom. Free to do what she wanted and not hold obligations that were never explained to her, Emilia would sneak out on many occasions while hiding the fact, doing everything from exploring to behaving mischievously as these were the times she would not have played the obedient \"good girl\" which helped in relieving her of loneliness. Until the day she met Geuse in a chance encounter whom she formed a strong friendship and whom would act not unlike something like a father figure. One day, Pandora and Regulus Corneas attacked Elior Forest to open the Seal within the deepest part of it, following into the death of Fortuna, the madness of Geuse. Emilia enraged when she saw the corpse of Fortuna who was killed by Pandora\'s powers and froze the whole forest, along with the citizens and Emilia herself. Emilia would blame herself for what happened as a consequence of breaking the taboos of the forest for personal desires and choosing to oppose Pandora to keep her promise with Fortuna which led to losing her aunt and Geuse.\n\nOver seven years before the start of the selection, Puck unfroze Emilia and began to live with her in the now snow-covered Elior Forest. Exposed to the outside world for some time now, Emilia came to face the hostile reality of what it meant to be a half-elf in the world, especially one with her appearance. From that time on, she suffered many hardships, not just from neighborhood human towns that feared her, hated her, betrayed her, and attempted to sell her into slavery but even from higher beings such as The Great Spirit of Fire who sought to exterminate her for the crime of her existence and dangerous power that slept on within her. Because of these issues, Emilia minimized any contact with outsiders, sticking to a frugal life by only leaving the forest to trade the magic stones she could find within with people willing to deal with her in humans\' towns for food and clothing. Humans who called her the \"Witch of Frost\" mostly tried to avoid her when she came around, but other than these excursions, Emilia would otherwise stay with the frozen elves as a guardian as they were connected to her past. After the harrowing incident with Melakuera, Emilia formed a contract with Puck to preserve his life after his Od had been damaged. Puck then began to act as her surrogate father and mentor. Puck used the contract itself to seal parts of her memories that had been tampered with by Pandora.\n\nA year before Subaru arrived she and Puck encountered Roswaal, the first human who didn\'t react negatively to her appearance. He then invited her to the Royal Selection after being chosen by the Dragon by giving her a way to save the citizens of Elior Forest, by using the dragon blood. Though now after experiencing the harsh state that she and other demi-humans have gone through, she also hopes to become a ruler that can mend relations between them and humans that the Witch of Envy destroyed with her reign of terror long ago. !~\n\n__Emilia\'s Abilities__\n~! __Spirit Affinity__: She has a rare innate gift to form contracts with spirits.\n\n__Spirit User__: Emilia is currently contracted with several Quasi Spirits and was formerly contracted with the Artificial Spirit Puck. During the incident at the Sanctuary, Puck broke his contract with her, causing her existing pendant to shatter, and she temporarily carried him around in a crystal stone that wasn\'t pure enough for her to use him properly. She later replaces her pendant with a new high purity crystal stone following the events at Priestella, however she states that she still doesn\'t have enough mana to form a new contract. Puck himself was a Human before he was made into an Artificial Spirit by Echidna and has some sort of contract with her that seals his former memories unless a certain condition is met. Some of Emilia\'s contract conditions are:\n\n- He will be active only from 9 am to 5 pm\n- Do not ask his relationship with Beatrice\n- Do not look into a mirror or go near a large body of water\n- Do not hide the fact that you are a half-elf\n- He will choose your hairstyle every morning\n- Groom his fur regularly\n- Have some exercise when you wake up and before going to bed.\n- Do not be picky about food\n- Talk with lesser spirits every morning and evening\n\n__Spirit Arts__: Emilia is capable of using this with Puck and her other spirits. Emilia and Puck can smoothly alternate between roles of offense and defense leading to devastating results. These include changing the atmosphere in the sky to rain down multitudes of ice spears, forming ice clones that are capable of attacking and using magic, instantly conjuring giant freezing blade discs, mist barriers that hide her presence and ice shields. On top of that Emilia is contracted to several Quasi Spirits; she can use them for various applications such as healing.\n\n__Equipment__ : Emilia wields a magical crystal known as a Pyroxene Crystal. After the fight between Roswaal and Ram, she received another Pyroxene Crystal from Subaru, which he got from Frederica Baumann. Currently, she keeps Puck within it and now is able to control the Lewes Meyer Copies to serve her.\n\n__Magic User__: Following the trials, Emilia remembered that she could use magic without Puck, and becomes able to use it again. It also made her aware of the abnormal amount of mana flowing through her. She is able to use ice magic through her natural fire attribute like her aunt Fortuna, to convert heat into ice.\n\n__Huma__: Emilia creates a shining water barrier that blocks other projectiles and sorts of magic. However, if the incoming magic is stronger than the shield it will get through it and cause damage to the user.\n\n__UI Huma__: Emilia summons massive ice pillars from thin air and hurls to it\'s target. It\'s capable of destroying an entire building.\n\n__Al Huma__: Emilia creates a sharp ten meter long spear of ice. The spear can also be modified to trap enemies.\n__Ice Brand Arts__: This technique allows Emilia to instantly conjure ice made weapons which she can use and freely manipulate in close-quarters combat. The weapons are very sturdy and are even capable of withstanding heat.\n\n__Ice Brand Arts__: Icicle Line: Emilia creates a limited area barrier made of ice particles around her opponent which she uses to attack in all directions by transforming them into weapons. Subaru helped in create the idea for this move.\n\n__Ice Flower__: Emilia creates flowers made of ice on wounds of living beings within a certain area that suck the host\'s life force and bloom by sucking the host\'s blood. Seven years ago, Emilia couldn\'t control the effect area and stop it properly. Puck had to use his powers to terminate it.\n\n__Melee Fighter__: While she leans more on the magical side, Emilia is also apt at close-quarters combat. Like Garfiel rather than having a known practiced form, she is a more instinctual fighter, relying on her body\'s natural talents such as its high nimbleness, sharp senses and above-average physical strength combined with her magical arts. This creates her own unique style. !~','2020-10-19 11:32:05','2020-10-19 11:32:05','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b88572-v2KimyNuU4XZ.jpg','SC'),(1876,'Crusch Karsten','__Birthday__: April 4\n\nCrusch Karsten is the Matriarch of House Karsten and a candidate to become the 42nd King of Lugnica.\n\n ~! Crusch was born as the only daughter and heir to Karsten family, one of the most powerful noble families in Lugnica. Even as child she considered an oddity among the nobility for being mature more than other children her age. Moreso as a girl who favored things like weapons over finery. As she grew older Crusch would developed a preference for men\'s clothing, and take on more masculine pursuits like learning swordplay which earned rumors about her from other nobles. Crusch held a strong fascination with history of Lion Kings (獅子王 Shishiou) which would come to serve as the basis for her radical but conflicted ideas about Lugunica present state. Her close friendships with both Fourier and Ferris would further have a huge influence on these aspects of herself and facilitate finding the balance between Crusch as a woman and Crusch the as noble she felt needed to become lead House Karsten.\n\nOn Crusch\'s 17th birthday an incident with Great Rabbit occured in the Karsten lands. Her efforts and leadership there would latter play a crucial role in her father passing down the position as the of head of family to her couple weeks afterward. Several years later, Crusch would catch wind of trouble afoot at House Arygle, through an report by her advisers. Not wanting this to burden Ferris whom still had trauma from his time with the Argyles nor let what was happening affect her attendant\'s standing among the knights in a very delicate period that would decide his future, Crusch would endeavor to take of the problem quietly herself and confer with Fourier to keep Ferris away from it.\n\nCrusch would directly head to Argyle estate to confront Biehn Argyle and Miles to learn the truth of the matter. After a tense conversation Crusch would fall into a trap she is drugged by the scent of odorless poison in the tea she had been given. She would find herself held in the same underground cell Ferris had lived in for years before his rescue by her. After a conversation with Biehn, Hannah Regret would later appear to loosen her manacles so she could escape when it was time. Crusch still completely unsure which side she was on would inquire about her motives and why she was betraying him. Hannah would only mention that it was out of love and Crusch wouldn\'t understand. It was at this point Crusch noticed the similarities between Hannah\'s appearance and Ferris, but the maid would leave before she could ask. Miles would soon visit Crusch himself intending break her will in preparation to make off with her and Ferris later, only for Crusch to reverse the situation to his shock by cutting him and the corpse soldiers around down. She then meet up with Julius in in the manor\'s first floor and then a distraught and shaken Ferris. The three would escape the blazing inferno the place had become.\n\nA year later, due to her increasing amount of workload brought about by royal family being unable to forfil their duties, Crusch found little time to visit Fourier after he fallen ill to the unknown epidemic sweeping through the palace. Eventually, one day during one her rare visits she brought Fourier out to gardens in the palace courtyard unbeknownst to her his would be the last time the two would speak. Reminiscing about the old days and reaffirming their childhood promise Fourier would die suddenly, but peacefully. During day the same day the current king would be the last royal to succumbed ending the Lugnica line. In the emergency meeting hereafter an emotional Crusch privately became outraged by how cavalier the royal court had treated this national tragedy moving on quickly as were a footnote compared to loss of the contract between the kingdom and dragon. It was there then that the Dragon Insignia as well as prophecy regarding the next step the country should take would be revealed. Crusch be discovered as first of the five potential candidates deeded worthy to lead the country. Learning this with strong conviction, Crusch would return to garden where Fourier died with Ferris and vow to forever server the tie between the dragon and Lugncia whose influence she become convinced had distorted the way Lugnica should be. !~\n\nCrusch is a beautiful woman with amber eyes and long dark green hair that reaches to the middle of her back. Even though she is a woman, she generally tends to dress as a man, and is described to be someone whose impression changes if she wears a dress and smiles.\n\nWhile normally calm and serious, Crusch is honest, sincere, right, being a type of person who is destined to stand above others, though she has talent and has worked hard to reach where she is now. She is already the head of her family, finishing her work better than her father. She prefers to act herself and has the pride of a warrior. Crusch is also gentle, often believing the false knowledge jokingly told to her by Ferris, and sometimes displays an airheaded side. Like her mother Helena Karsten, she is shown to be ruthless and reckless.\n\nCrusch is also dense toward any feelings of love above kindness, often not understanding why certain people behave a certain way, such as when she sometimes didn\'t understand Fourier\'s behavior. However, this only applies to feelings of love directed towards herself, as she has been shown to comment on the feelings of others.\n\n(Source: Re:Zero Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:32:05','2020-10-19 11:32:05','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b90185-FR9JHyNe5038.jpg','MC'),(1877,'Puck','Puck is an Artificial Spirit that Emilia was formerly contracted with.

Wilhelm was born the third son of the Trias family, whom lived in the countryside of the Kingdom of Lugnica. They were an old house of nobility situated in one of the kingdom’s most remote northern province which bordered Holy Kingdom of Gusteko, and had the responsibly for managing the some of the territories there. Once a proud warrior family, their days of military glory were a thing of the past, and by the time Wilhelm was born they were little more than a small barony running meager lands with a small population of serfs. Unlike his much older siblings, Wilhelm had neither the claim to inherent leadership in the family or knack for civil governance leaving him little hope in his own future prospects until the day he picked up his family\'s treasured sword. Enchanted by the blade, he would spend 6 years of his youth in the mountains near his home swinging it day and night as it gave him a sense of peace and purposed that his life had lacked up til now and each time he swung it he felt himself growing stronger. By the time he has 14, he had become the most skilled swordsman in the domain. However one night due to a severe quarrel with his eldest brother over his future would leave his family and travel to the royal capital to become a knight.\n\nAt the time country had been going through a civil war with the Demi-human Alliance, a group of demi-human tribes for some years that began in its eastern region when Wilhelm enlisted. From the time of his first battle on Wilhelm would stand out and make a named for himself due to his near unparalleled skill despite his age. On the field he was a ferocious and tenacious soldier who leaped into enemy formations leaving nothing but scores of corpses, as he cut through with reckless abandon and a wicked smile on his face. His daredevil like behavior and action would earn him the moniker \"Sword Demon\" from the royal military forces and foe alike who look on him in awe, fear and hatred. However despite his military achievements and national renown skill Wilhelm would receive no promotion. This was partly because he refused, but also since Wilhelm was very anti-social, barely having anyone he called friends, rarely conversing with anyone and fighting heedless of the danger it brought his allies. Knighthood which rested on things beyond battle like bonds between people seemed ill-fitting for him as someone who only fought to suppress the discontent in his heart.\n\nFor 3 years Wilhelm continued to live his life on the battlefield like this until one day due to the changing conditions of the civil war he found himself on forced leave in the royal capital for a time. It was during this period that a dissatisfied Wilhelm with too much time on his hands and little to do with it met Theresia in the abandoned construction site within the royal capital where he had come to train regularly. This meeting although beginning innocuously at first would eventually change Wilhelm\'s life in a profound way. Despite his best efforts to remain detached from her company in over 3 months, he finds himself increasingly drawn to Theresia who often rebuffed his crude manners and afoot persona. Unaware of subtle changes in his heart at first, subconsciously he started looking forward to their ritualistic meetings which eventually led him to question the real reason why he had continued to walk the path of the sword which he had been avoiding his life up until now. Coming to an epiphany, Wilhelm realized that he had been using it as an excuse to run away from his problems at home. Wanting to do something his older brothers couldn\'t and support his family in his own way as they did. Accepting this fact Wilhelm found himself caring about things he hadn\'t in a long time, becoming less and less concerned with taking the heads of his enemies over prioritizing the safety of his comrades. For such an infamous figure in the royal military his changes did not go unnoticed and mostly welcomed among his peers. Wilhelm would receive calls and support for knighthood once again but this time he comes to take up, because he found a new reason to wield his sword, no longer just for his self-satisfaction, but rather to protect the things he cared about and the happiness of one person who became irreplaceable in his life.\n\nDisaster would strike shortly after Wilhelm attained his wish when news of the intensifying civil war had spread all the way to far reaches of the northernmost regions of the country where the Trias territory lay. Wilhelm defying conduct would race home only to find his hometown already sacked and faced with more demi-humans forces than he ever fought before. Wilhelm who seemed to finally be hitting the limits of his ability would have nearly perished as a result had he not been saved by the newest incarnation of the Sword Saint who turned out to be none other than Theresia. Feeling humiliated, but captivated by her display of swordsmanship he could never reach, and most of all indignation at war, society and his weak self that had forced her to resign herself to the inescapable fate to take up the mantle of \"Sword Saint\", Wilhelm would confront Theresia leading them to part ways with their resolve to protect the other. 2 years would pass before they saw each other again at the ceremony to celebrate the end of a decade long war. There a much stronger Wilhelm would enter an impassioned duel with Theresia in which after a close match the former would defeat latter. Making good on his promise Wilhelm would free her from the duties and burden of Sword Saint and take them up in her stead so that she could live the life she wants. A year later they would go on to marry one another.\n\nIn the present story, Wilhelm has come under the service of Crusch Karsten after leaving the Royal Guard and House of Astrea nearly 14 years ago, to gain her assistance in hunting the White Whale in exchange for his support for her in the Royal Selection. !~\n\nWilhelm has white hair and blue eyes. He wears a white shirt, white vest, black bowtie, black dress pants, and a black and blue coat. Due to his daily training, he is still muscular at his old age, and his back perfectly straight. When he was young, Wilhelm had brown hair, and wore the Royal Guard uniform.\n\nWilhelm is a refined man with a highly gentle and humble demeanor. However unearth that even temperament belied a fierce warrior who often is the first to help when something happens. However this wasn\'t always the case as in youth, Wilhelm was very opposite of who he was in his later years. Brash, afoot, short tempered, lonely and often cold with others. He was a troubled individual who devoted himself wholly to the sword and cared for little else. Even so, he knew how to analyze a situation, always finding a way out. Nonetheless, Theresia greatly influenced his personality, becoming increasingly sociable and protective, achieving more results during the Demi-human War. It was through her most of all that he would become the person he is today.\n\n(Source: Re:Zero Wikia)','2020-10-19 11:32:06','2020-10-19 11:32:06','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b90179-dBqDPUn2i7dM.jpg','SC'),(1880,'Daphne','Daphne is one of the Witches of Sin, being the Witch of Gluttony.

From the moment Ferris was born, he had cat like appendages due to his ancestors having Demi Human blood, causing his parents to mistreat him as they suspected an affair. He was locked in the basement of the Argyle Mansion for the first nine years of his life and was barely cared for. When Crusch found him, she described him as \"a fragile boy who was painfully thin, was black from being covered in dirt and filth, and couldn\'t talk properly\". He was subsequently taken to the Karsten Mansion to be cared for and made Crusch attendant while his parents lost what little standing they had with the Karsten family, leading to their decline.\n\nIn the following years to come Ferris would establish a strong sense of loyalty and devotion towards Crusch for taking him form the hell that was his life before and base part of his new identity on that relationship. He also came to befriend Fourier Lugnica a little while after the prince met Crusch. Together 3 would get into all kinds of mischief that defined much of their friendship.\n\nAt age 18, Ferris would join the Royal Guard under recommendations from Fourier and Royal Institute of Healing. Although he wanted to be of better use to Crusch, Ferris at first was not very comfortable in being the elite group for several reasons, he stood out due to his odd features marking him as a demi-human, his preference for wearing women\'s clothing, his own lacking combat abilities and lastly dissatisfaction of his unusual and sudden appointment despite all that from the other knights. However on the first day, he also came to be acquainted with Reinhard van Astrea and Julius Juukulius which would be first step in breaking the wall between Ferris and his new environment. Through his good relationship with both of them and the subtle opportunities to display his worth crafty granted by Marcos Gildark, Ferris would come to earn the respect of the other knights for saving their lives with his magic. This would come to give him a sense of his abilities and place there.\n\nIn the last month of his probationary period in the Royal Guard before he became a permanent member, dark rumors surrounding his old family would reach his ears via Fourier. Learning that Crusch had gone to investigate them, Ferris together with Fourier and Julius would rush back to the Karsten estate to learn the truth of the situation. After their arrival things would take a turn for worse when they learn that Crusch had been captured and her men were engaged an with an undead army outside the Argyle household. Ferris would also receive a message from his father that would demand he come to Argyle estate alone in exchange for saving Crusch. Returning to Argyle mansion for first time in nearly a decade Ferris would confront his father and a maid named Hannah who he felt a familiar connection to. Following a cold reunion Ferris would acquiesce to his father\'s demand to revive his mother with the Argyle\'s family ancient spell.

He was locked in the basement of the Argyle Mansion for the first nine years of his life and was barely cared for. When Crusch found him, she described him as \"a fragile boy who was painfully thin, was black from being covered in dirt and filth, and couldn\'t talk properly\". He was subsequently taken to the Karsten Mansion to be cared for and made Crusch attendant while his parents lost what little standing they had with the Karsten family, leading to their decline.\n\nIn the following years to come Ferris would establish a strong sense of loyalty and devotion towards Crusch for taking him form the hell that was his life before and base part of his new identity on that relationship.

Although he wanted to be of better use to Crusch, Ferris at first was not very comfortable in being the elite group for several reasons, he stood out due to his odd features marking him as a demi-human, his preference for wearing women\'s clothing, his own lacking combat abilities and lastly dissatisfaction of his unusual and sudden appointment despite all that from the other knights.

Mizore returns to school after a delayed absence and was first portrayed as a lonely, somewhat depressed, and misunderstood girl.

In the past, she confessed her love to a teacher until he began taking advantage of her, freezing him as a result. With the incident and rumors spreading about her, Mizore made it hard for herself to trust anyone, but took a liking to Tsukune, believing he was just as miserable as she was. She eventually regains her sense of trust after Tsukune intervenes when the same teacher returns to kill her. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis (from around 340 spying locations, according to her).

Later in the second serialization, Mizore decides that even if Tsukune doesn&#039;t fall in love with her, she will follow him forever.  A running gag in the series is that Mizore always appears unexpectedly in the oddest locations (under tables, behind doors, the ceiling, bushes, and even in the bathroom), and freezes any girl to disrupt any sort of tender moment Tsukune is having with the latter.   Keeping in line with her kind, Mizore has the ability to control snow and ice at will, and while doing so, shapes claws of ice around her hands (her hair becomes ice on rare occasions). She can also make almost perfect copies (if a bit fragile) of herself and others with it as well, each capable of independent thought.

Upon remembering the kind of love her parents had given her, she attempts to persuade her mistress to call off her plan but to no avail, as her mistress was bent on destroying the human world. She disappears after her mistress is defeated and put to rest, and reappears when Tsukune becomes out of control as a ghoul, aiding Mikogami in sealing his abilities. She now resides at Yōkai Academy as Mikogami\'s aide and continues to work for him in the second manga serialization.

The anime omits the presence of her master or the inclusion of her parents, drastically changing the events surrounding her, including the reasons behind her return.

She tries to seduce Tsukune and the male student body, using her charming techniques (through her succubi abilities, including her busty physique), making them her slaves. This is so she can find her \"mate of fate\", in order to save her diminishing species, with the assumption that Moka is blocking her path. After Tsukune persuades the unsealed Moka to spare her, she becomes infatuated with him and makes a decision that he will be her \"mate of fate\", becoming friends with the pair.  While she does continue to tease and try to seduce Tsukune, it is clear that she possesses true and honest feelings for him- she\'s been shown to be willing to risk her life for him numerous times throughout the anime and manga. In the manga, Kurumu is shown to be a kind and soft-hearted girl who loves her rivals for Tsukune\'s love like sisters, tenderly comforting and supporting them in their moments of sadness, as well as defending them when they are in danger. This kind-hearted character-trait is downplayed in the anime in favor of a more typical \"flirt\" character, although the kind-heartedness is still present, and in reality, she is actually an innocent character. Despite this, an often running gag in both series is when she uses her breasts to seduce Tsukune, which, more often than not, makes his nose bleed and causes him to suffocate. She also attempts to use baked sweets laced with love potions to secure his affections, though they never seem to reach him. Also, no matter where they are, she somehow manages to interfere with any tender moment between Tsukune and Moka, often by appearing when least expected.  In an omake, Kurumu reveals she has a serious weakness for sweets, to the extent that she once ate poisoned cookies that she made and planned to give to Moka. The incident seems to have bought her some control over this trait, as the aforementioned love sweets are intact whenever they appear. Described as a tough character, Kurumu sports a pair of bat wings, tail and razor-sharp nails in her true form, and has notable body strength (seen when carrying people during flight). The use of illusions and reality-bending techniques make up for her lack of combat abilities. Kurumu also carries a unique, innate sense of knowing when danger might occur. As of the second manga serialization, she is learning basic witchcraft.

Seemingly innocent and deeply concerned for her students\' grades, she offers private lessons to anyone willing, though at a price (according to Kurumu, Ririko tends to go overboard with her tutoring, and envies her for her large breasts). As such, she uses her abilities to drain her students\' emotions in exchange for knowledge, which is done through a flower-like appendage on her tail. She also seems to have a fetish for S&amp;M outfits, claiming that it makes her male students \"work harder\".However, this might be only what she thinks in her warped mind.  In both the manga and anime series, Ririko tries to enslave Tsukune when he is forced to have tutoring by her in order to correct his failing grades in math, and believes that Moka is in the way of his studies (she caught Moka trying to suck Tsukune\'s blood, but misinterpreted it). But when Moka attempts to rescue him, Tsukune snaps out of Ririko\'s control long enough to remove Moka\'s rosario, leading to her defeat by Moka\'s vampire form (she was given a two-week suspension according to Tsukune, meaning she will be allowed to return to work, unlike Ishigami).  She reappears later in chapter 19, apparently not holding a grudge, to warn Tsukune and Moka about Okuto Kotsubo. While she no longer bears a grudge against Moka in the manga, her grudge against her remains in the anime, shown when she attempted to take Moka hostage only to be stopped by Nekonome in a catwoman costume. Also, her anime incarnation is slightly more perverse than her manga counterpart. It is important to note that unlike other antagonists, she is not inherently evil, but rather very passionate about the education of the academy\'s students as well as the status between teachers and students.

She is a witch who dons a typical witch costume (consisting of a hat and cape), which is considered by some students to be a violation of the school rules, and frequently ends her sentences with \"desu\", which roughly translates to \"it is\". However, it can also have the effect of raising the politeness of one\'s speech. As a witch, she has problems with her classmates discriminating against her (according to Kurumu, witches are viewed as \"Beings of the Borderline\", those that are something between humans and the supernatural, as it is impossible to tell their difference by appearance alone).   Despite ranking #1 on the examinations, she was a lonely prankster before meeting Tsukune and Moka. She initially hated Tsukune, claiming that she has fallen in love with Moka, and uses her magical powers to try to drive them apart. However, after both Tsukune and Moka save her from bullying classmates, she falls for him too, and her obsession with both has driven her to try to create a three-way relationship between them.   Despite her genius IQ, Yukari is very childish in nature, and is often indecisive on whether or not she either loves Tsukune or Moka more than the other. Though it seems that despite her young age, Yukari might be bisexual, as she still has interest in Tsukune as well as Moka. This action was displayed in an omake when Kurumu asks Yukari a similar question to which Yukari answers both, only for her to choose Moka.  She often clashes with Kurumu, often teasing her about her large breasts, but they often team up on some occasions, such as the case in the Witch\'s Knoll arc, and are in reality friendly rivals. In the anime, she is the only girl of the group to actually kiss Tsukune.  As a witch, Yukari can cast various spells through her heart-shaped magic wand, her motif usually revolving around tarot cards and washtubs. She can also use her wand to manipulate various objects and use them as weapons, as with the case where she uses brooms to drive away Tsukune in her introductory chapter. A running gag throughout the series is where she often drops a washtub on someone who is annoying, usually Kurumu or Mizore (and Gin on rare occasions).   Yukari is quite powerful as a witch and has great potential given the right motivation, one instance is when she defeats an army of monster plants by herself during the Witch\'s Knoll arc.   Yukari has, on occasion, developed some bizarre items, such as the Gro-Gro Drops for Kokoa, often leading to hilarious results or farfetched situations.

Tsukune Aono is a young man who has failed all of his high school entrance exams. With no options left for him, his parents sends him to Yōkai Academy. Upon arriving there however, he soon discovers that it is a special school for monsters and demons alike, and any human who discovers its existience will be killed. Fearing for his life, he later meets Moka Akashiya, a beautiful girl who turns out to be a vampire. Soon after he becomes friends with her, he soon learns from her that she hates humans. After revealing his secret to Moka to the latter\'s shock, he then decides to return to the human world, but relents at the last minute when he comes to rescue her from a bullying student, stating that he really likes her and wants to become her friend. Soon after the misunderstanding was cleared, he decides to stay at Yokai Academy regardless of the impending danger that awaits him.  Though considerate and polite, Tsukune is a gentle person even though there have been many instances, where he has been put into dangerous, life-threatening situations (many of which are due to enemies whom he later befriends), he has never held a grudge against anyone. Tsukune\'s selflessness and courage comes to the foreground, whenever he or someone from his group of friends is faced with the possibility of injury, or even death. Though powerless, he has the tendency of throwing himself into danger to ensure the safety of his friends. As the series progresses, this habit becomes extremely dangerous the enemies he encounters are so powerful that he frequently comes close to dying. Ironically, this leads to a situation where he calls upon \"his own\" supernatural abilities (originally from Inner Moka) as well as the concealment of his human identity from much of the student body.

He is half-Japanese but, unlike his brother Isami, appears more European – with blond hair and blue eyes – and is noted as being extremely handsome, having fan clubs in Tōtsuki Academy and his hometown. He enrolled in Tōtsuki at the behest of his uncle, taking with him his mezzaluna (two-handed knife) and a bottle of homemade olive oil as a good luck charm. His specialty is Italian cuisine, although many professional chefs noted that he has a broad vision; like Sōma, he will incorporate ingredients and methods from other culinary styles to create inventive dishes, and can modify his recipes while cooking. He is very kind and supportive of his less-skilled brother, to the point of risking his pride to defend Isami\'s honor.\n\nTakumi has a fierce (and somewhat one-sided) rivalry with Sōma. Takumi sees Sōma as someone similar to himself – both having grown-up working at small family restaurants – and a worthy rival, and jumps at any chance to compete with him. He frequently tries to challenge Sōma to informal cooking challenges (usually leading to an embarrassing situation for himself), hoping to one day defeat Sōma in a formal Shokugeki. Despite their rivalry, both he and Sōma greatly respect each other, and likely view each other as friends outside of the arena.\n\n~!In the quarter-finals of the Autumn Elections tournament, Takumi was provoked by Mimasaka Subaru into betting his mezzaluna on their match, and lost. Sōma defeats Subaru in a Shokugeki held parallel with their semi-final match and obtains the mezzaluna, but Takumi tells Sōma to keep it until he can win it back.

Jōichirō is supportive of his son but does occasionally like to see Sōma stressed and frustrated by challenging him to many cook-offs – always ending in Jōichirō\'s victory – to show him how much he has to grow.

A talented and creative chef, he earned the nickname Asura (literally \'demon\') after he single handedly defeated up to 100 opponents in a regimental shokugeki. During the middle of his third year, the pressure of continuously creating new dishes took its toll on Jōichiro. To the point that he skipped B.L.U.E, the world youth cooking championships, in which he was favourite to win. Gin and Senzaemon blamed themselves, and suggested Jōichiro withdrew from the academy and travel the world to learn about cooking on his own terms. Azami, who was two generations behind Jōichirō and wanted to push Jōichirō\'s skills to fulfill his ideal of \"true gourmet\", was resentful when Jōichirō left without graduating. Eventually, Jōichiro returned to Japan where he met his wife and opened a family restaurant.!~\n\n~!Jōichirō is a close friend of the Nakiri family, often requested by Senzaemon to privately cook for him. On one such occasion, a young Erina curiously followed the aroma of his cooking, and was allowed to join them.

Kurisu is a research member in Victor Qondria University\'s Brain Research Program. Her age group matches that of third-year high schoolers, but she skipped a grade through America\'s educational system. She is also famous in America for writing theses papers, part of which is covered in the news. Thanks to skipping a grade in America as a girl, she was envied by people around her, and ended up building a strong personality. She does not want to show weakness to others, so she always has a stern expression. However, she is very curious, and when she builds interest, she pokes into things. Occasionally, she has views that differ from regular opinions, such as, \"The experiment data is more important than the subject\'s privacy.\" Rintarou often tells her, \"Hey, you\'ve got a pretty good sense of being a Mad Scientist,\" but she is not one to agree to such things personally. She is a tsundere.\n\nRintarou has given her plenty of nicknames, in particular \"Christina\" (クリスティーナ) and \"Assistant\" (助手).\n\n~!\nIn the future of the Alpha world line where SERN rules, Makise worked for them. She made major contributions to the completion of SERN\'s time machine and was praised as \"Mother of Time Machine.\" In the side story \"The Far Valhalla,\" which explores Kurisu\'s, Okabe\'s, and Daru\'s fate after being captured by SERN, it\'s revealed that Okabe devised a plan to escape from SERN\'s headquarter in France, but as SERN learned that it would rule the world in the future, it let Okabe and Daru go in order to complete the cycle of fate. Kurisu gave up and stayed behind, but still believed that Okabe would be able to overcome fate. In 2034, she completed the time machine and was executed by SERN. Kurisu\'s allegiance with SERN in the future is the reason Suzuha, a member of the resistance against SERN\'s rule in 2036, is initially distrustful of her. However, Suzuha\'s opinion changes after she learns more about Kurisu\'s nature.\n\nKurisu and her father are not on the best terms. When she was little, her father\'s lectures would fascinate her so much that she would read up on them herself. It was not long before she started getting into the science field. Because of her talent, she would always outsmart her own father, causing the two to come to bad terms.!~\n\n~!Kurisu develops feelings toward Okabe.!~\n\n(Source: naomi.thewafflehouse.net)','2020-10-19 11:34:16','2020-10-19 11:34:16','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b34470-iPv1JxglAfpD.png','SC'),(2243,'Akihiko Kayaba','__Age__: 28\n\nAkihiko Kayaba is the Director and Creator of the Nerve Gear and Sword Art Online.

He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina\'s attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki\'s helmet in the fight.  Viral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren\'s capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane\'s side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph\'s demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren\'s foot from crushing her. After Adiane\'s death by the Dai-Gurren\'s attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.  Under Supreme General Cytomander\'s command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander\'s aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina\'s death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King\'s permission to execute him for treason, but Viral\'s last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen\'s existance before making him immortal. Viral\'s last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King\'s throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without \"Spiral Energy\" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.   ~!After Lord Genome\'s defeat and the fall of Teppelin, Viral\'s whereabouts were unknown, until he was sighted causing an uproar with his Gunmen, and demanding Simon to fight him, but Rossiu stopped Simon from going after him and sent their Guraparl force instead. Gimmy and Darry together managed to take down Viral\'s Enkidudu and put him under custody. When questioned by Simon about why he continues to fight even after the war ended, Viral stated that his intention was to protect a human settlement which refused to leave the underground. Simon would eventually discover that Rossiu was forcing people out of their villages without his consent, in order to count them to find out how close mankind\'s population was from reaching the one million danger level, stated by Lord Genome. Viral is sent to the Rikone prison and reappears in the end of episode 19, when he re-encounters Simon, who was imprisoned there, awaiting for his death sentence to be carried on. Both end up locked in individual cells after a brawl, but after Simon is rescued by Yoko, Viral is also released by him and accepts his proposal to join Team Dai-Gurren against the Anti-Spirals, as the Gurren\'s pilot. This position is cemented after the battle, when Simon declares him the Gurren\'s official pilot in a meeting with the Team members; this title goes uncontested.  In episode 26, we discover that Viral\'s greatest desire is to have a family, however, this will always be impossible, since Beastmen cannot reproduce. Despite being a Beastman, he obtains a Core Drill when broken free from the Anti-Spiral\'s illusion, even though Beastmen should not be able to produce Spiral Energy. In the epilogue, Viral is seen commanding the Chouginga Dai-Gurren, as a representative for Earth, in the upcoming Spiral Peace Conference; due to his immortality, his appearance stays the same, in spite of the fact that 20 years had passed.!~ Viral\'s name comes directly from the word \"viral\", tying in with the Beastmen\'s genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name\'s origin. One is the fact that it can also be an anagram for \"rival\", referring to his constant rivalry with Kamina, which transfered to Simon throughout the series until near the end. Another possible theory comes from the Nikopol Trilogy of comic books written by Enki Bilal, as Enki is the name of Viral\'s first Gunmen and \"Bilal\", pronounced in Japanese, sounds like \"Viral\". Supporting this theory is Viral\'s theme song, which is titled \"Nikopol\", on the anime\'s soundtrack.  The name of Viral\'s Gunmen may be tied to the Sumerian diety Enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second Gunmen, Enkidu, and the character of Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The myth consists of Enkidu (\'Enki\'s creation\'), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge King Gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels.','2020-10-19 11:34:39','2020-10-19 11:34:39','https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/n2378-UcNU2Pm8MlB9.png','SC'),(2300,'Boota','Simon&#039;s sidekick.

Golden Darkness is currently staying on Earth, roaming around the city streets and Sainan High, with a motivation to continue her duty to assassinate Rito, although she has yet to accomplish this (hinting she only said this as an excuse to stay on Earth, which is then confirmed). Commonly referred as \"Yami-chan\", she spends her time reading books and magazines, while eating taiyaki (it is the only thing she eats on Earth since it is the first food offered by Rito, prior to spending a night at the Yuuki residence for a sukiyaki dinner). By her planet\'s calculations, she is 24 years-old, despite having the appearance of an 11-year-old (albeit a rather mature one), although this is only mentioned in the anime and has a weakness towards anything slimy.\n\nLike Lala, Golden Darkness\' physical abilities are exponentially stronger than a human\'s. She carries a unique ability to turn her body parts into various objects through use of nano machines circulating her body, ranging from swords to dragon heads.

She is usually addressed as \"Oshizu\" (お静?); the O (お?) is an honorific used to refer to women. When frightened, she can emit blasts of mental stress, blowing apart various objects and surroundings, but is also capable of manipulating others through sheer willpower. A related gag is the blasts of stress frequently rip apart clothing, resulting in Rito being in an awkward situation with one of the female cast. Since her meeting with Rito and the others, she begins exploring the world outside the old school building. Oshizu is aware of Haruna\'s crush on Rito by her ability to sense feelings while possessing another person and becomes very supportive towards cheering Haruna into confessing her feelings to him.  Oshizu \"returns\" to the living, after Ryouko creates a prosthetic body for her to inhabit, built with biological qualities (looking and feeling like an actual, human body). However, she occasionally \"disconnects\" during brief moments of excitement, her spirit leaving her prosthetic body. She currently works as a nurse for Ryouko, while Ryouko maintains Oshizu\'s physical body. In the first anime, Oshizu is not given a new body and her presence is limited, while she has her body as she does in the manga for the OVA releases and the new anime.

She also uses an invention of Lala which enables her to store her friends in a virtual space and summon them at will.  Nana stated that she is the inferior twin, being flat. People say that she is the worser behaved of the two, even though Nana says it\'s because most do not know of Momo\'s dark side. Despite this, even after they argue, they make up again.

He is a normal brown haired 16 year old student of Sainan High, and he has a big crush on Haruna Sairenji. He attempted numerous times to confess to her but has met with failure each time. Rito used to be on the soccer team in junior high and was quite good, but quit because he was constantly helping his father with his mangaka duties, thus did not want to leave his little sister Mikan Yuuki alone in the house. Mikan comments he is very good at the most \"useless little things\", like crane and festival games (e.g. hoops, catching fish, squirt guns). Along with the numerous useless little things Rito is good at, he is also an accomplished florist, gardener, and horticulturalist.\n\nRito\'s nature is borderline clumsy, where he always ends up ogling or groping the many girls in the series (though mostly unintentionally). It is only by accident that he encounters and despite his enduring feelings for Haruna, Rito shows signs of developing deeper affection towards Lala a troublesome character that at first pretends to show affectionate feelings for Rito Yuki through the beggining of the story. As the story progresses he starts to show affection for Lala but is unsure if what he feels is actually love. This is shown again when he couldn\'t help but think about Lala even though he was with a naked Haruna. It is recently revealed that he is in love with Lala, but he is also in love with Haruna. At the end of the series, he confesses to Lala, but tells her he also loves Haruna, yet she is happy on both parts. He is confused as polygamy is illegal in Japan where Lala replied that once he is king of the universe the laws of earth no longer apply and forces him to go tell Haruna (strapping a jet pack to his back). Right before he was about to tell her, she moves out of the way, just like when he confessed to her very early in the series, leading him to state \"I love you\" to all of the female cast with the exception of Momo, Mikan, Golden Darkness, and Haruna herself. The ending implies that his \"love\" troubles will continue on into the future.\n\n~! __Riko\'s sizes:__\n __Height:__ 163 cm \n__Weight:__ 52.5 kg \n__BWH:__ 85-55.5-84 cm \n\nRiko is Rito\'s female alter-ego, she is a beautiful girl (with a physical appearance resembling a tomboy) who gets much attention from men, such as Taizou Motemitsu, the principal and even Kenichi Saruyama, Rito\'s best friend.

Haruna has similar feelings for him, having been attracted to his kind, gentle nature since junior high. Despite her growing love for Rito, which she believes to be unrequited, she usually suppresses her feelings and cannot confess to him because of her friendship with Lala who also loves Rito. However, with some encouragement, she tells Lala of her ordeal, to which Lala accepts, claiming Haruna as her rival for Rito\'s heart, while remaining friends. She lives with her older sister Akiho Sairenji in an apartment and has a severe fear of ghosts and the supernatural, the exception being Oshizu Murasame but only to an extent.\n\nWhen frightened, she has a habit of grabbing the nearest thing around her – typically Rito – and swinging him wildly, in an attempt to get rid of whatever frightens her.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\"</p>\n<h3>Section 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\", written by Cicero in 45 BC</h3>\n<p>\"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

Rackham</h3>\n<p>\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"</p>',1,1,0,1,'2020-10-15 12:55:29','2020-10-20 10:08:49'),(6,'',1,1,1,1,'2020-10-15 17:57:54','2020-10-20 15:03:36'),(8,'<p>Inspired by American superhero comics, Horikoshi Kouhei\'s Boku no Hero Academia (or \'My Hero Academia\' in English) manga started publishing two years ago, but got gained a lot of popularity only after the release of One Punch Man anime. But being honest here, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed by it.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Story: 6/10</strong><br />The story is rather childish. In the world of My Hero Academia, on one fine day, out of nowhere, new born babies started having some random super powers which are called \'quirks\'. With that, evil villains emerged, and with that heroes emerged&nbsp;<span id=\"review221986\">too, which soon became usual and was accepted by the society. Our main protagonist of the show, Izuku Midoriya, who is always bullied by his childhood friend Bakugou Katsuki who has a great quirk, wanted to join the prestigious \'Hero School\', UA, and become the best hero in the world like \'All Might\'. But he discovered in his childhood that he is \'quirkless\', but finding the potential in him due to various situations, All Might passes on his quirk to him which is somewhat like ultimate strength, speed and endurance. But due to his weak body and lack of practice, he always hurts his body due to the recoil. Anyway, he manages to clear the UA entrance exam and now he must struggle in the school to pass out as a pro hero.<br />Okay, so far so good. But from this point, the excitement goes downhill. Bad jokes, predictable events, childish plot, and what not, makes it seem more like an American Cartoon than a Japanese Anime.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Art: 7/10</strong><br />Bones Studio, very popular for it\'s work in Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, delivers some of the best artworks out there. But this time, it gambled with My Hero Academia. The graphics are very sketchy and it feels like we are reading a comic book. It may be a hit for some people. But honestly speaking, it was a miss for me.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Sound: 9/10</strong><br />There is no doubt that Porno Graffitti, the most misunderstood band name, did an amazing job for the OP with the song \'The Day\'. The fast and catchy song and the visuals along with it are very good and fits the mood. \'Heroes\' by Brian the Sun is another great ED. And guess what? Kaji Yuki performed the role of Todoroki Shouto! Also other talented voice actors like Okamoto Nobuhiko, Suwabe Junichi, Kitamura Eri, Yuuki Aoi, Inoue Marina did a great job. The OSTs during the action scenes are really good too.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Character: 6/10</strong><br />This is the biggest negative point for the show. The characters, are well, lame. Everyone is either silly or one dimensional or simply annoying. They all have unique quirks which make them different from each other. But still, they are lame.<br />Bakugou Katsuki is the lamest and the most annoying of all the characters. He exists just to bully Midoriya Izuku to make the anime more shounenish.<br />Midoriya Izuku is no good either. A lame-ass who usually cries over stupid things instead of fighting like a man. He is a fan boy who cries tears of happiness like a girl when he is able to see some pro hero. That\'s seriously lame.<br />All Might, the strongest hero in the world is the silliest childhood-hero like character. He has got some weird hairstyle and dialogues without any punch. He has one alternate form in which he shrinks to a thinner size with a gunny un-proportional face and body, which may have been shown for comedy, but I found it silly.<br />Eraser Head is the only character whom I found interesting and mature. Reminded me of Kakashi Hatake from Naruto. :P<br /><br /><br /><strong>Enjoyment: 8/10</strong><br />I enjoyed the show only in some parts of it (mostly the action part). The rest of the show was silly, childish, predictable and it felt like it was targeted for pre-teens. But anyway, if you have already watched a lot of good anime, then this anime is suited for casual watching.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Overall: 7.2/10</strong><br />If you are a pre-teen or younger, you will like or maybe love this show. It has all the scenes and factors which today\'s generation kids love (I guess). If you are a matured adult who is not into silly comedy, bullied-kid-turned-into-superhero or someone who finds funny villains evil, you should probably avoid this anime.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"review221986\"><br />+Sound<br />+A few action scenes<br />+Good for audience below the age of 16 years<br /><br />-Poor plot, many loopholes<br />-Silly and annoying comedy<br />-Silly and annoying characters<br />-Comic book sketch-like art<br />-Not good for mature audience</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"review221986\"><br /><br />It\'s like a rip off of Marvel, DC and One Punch Man. But a bad one. Good for casual watching, if you have already watched a lot of good anime and have nothing new to watch. If you like shounen super power anime, then you will like this anime. I have a feeling that the sequel is going to be better.
